- <img src=":/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef" width="10" height="11"></img>
    - HTML images just before a sublist should have a closing &lt;img&gt; tag added.
    - Otherwise, when rendered to Markdown again, the subsequent list items will be rendered as HTML.
- <img src=":/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef" width="10" height="11"></img>  
    **A closing tag is also necessary if the image is followed by content on a new line.**
- ![](:/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef)
    - Similar logic isn't necessary for images converted to Markdown.
- <img src=":/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef" width="10" height="11">
- It also isn't necessary if the next item is at the same level as the image...
- ...or if the image has text just before it. <img src=":/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef" width="10" height="11">
