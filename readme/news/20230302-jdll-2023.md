# Joplin will participate in JdLL 2023!

On 1 and 2 April 2023, we will have a stand for Joplin at the [Journ√©es du Logiciel Libre](https://www.jdll.org/) in Lyon, France. The JdLL has been taking place in Lyon for 24 years and is a popular open source conference in France. We had a stand in 2020 and 2021 but that was cancelled due to Covid, so this year is a first for Joplin!

Admission is free, so don't hesitate to come and meet us, exchange ideas and learn more about Joplin!
