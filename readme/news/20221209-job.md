# Joplin is hiring!

Joplin is an open source note-taking app. Capture your thoughts and securely access them from any device.

We are looking to hire two JavaScript software developers to work on the desktop, mobile, and server applications. All those are built using modern technologies, including React, React Native and Electron with a strong focus on test units.

You need to demonstrate some experience with at least some of these technologies, and willing to learn more and touch various different projects.

You will be part of a small team, so you will have an opportunity for a high-impact role, targeting hundreds of thousands of users.

If you're interested please contact us at job-AT-joplin.cloud

No agencies please.
