# Project 3: Rocketbook integration with Joplin

Joplin is partnering with a French government institution to bring you innovative new features! We will work on accessibility, voice typing, HTR and add Rocketbook integration. Today we'll present the planned Rocketbook integration:

[Rocketbook](https://getrocketbook.com/pages/how-rocketbook-works) is a popular brand of smart notebooks designed to make note-taking more efficient and sustainable. These notebooks feature special erasable pages that you can write on with specific pens and then wipe clean with a damp cloth. What makes Rocketbook even more appealing is its ability to scan and upload your notes to cloud services for easy storage and sharing.

We plan to create an integration between Rocketbook and Joplin, designed to make the note-taking process even smoother. While Rocketbook typically works through its own official app, we plan to integrate it directly into Joplin without relying on third-party apps or APIs. This means that you can enjoy the benefits of Rocketbook’s smart features while using Joplin as your primary note-taking platform.

The great thing about this integration is that it’s not limited to just Rocketbook. As long as the smart notebook uses QR codes to identify pages, the same functionality will work. This means you can use Joplin with a wide variety of smart notebooks, making it a versatile tool for all your note-taking needs.

With this integration, we’re making it easier than ever to combine the power of smart notebooks with the flexibility of Joplin’s open-source platform. Whether you're using Rocketbook or another smart notebook, Joplin will be ready to help you organise and access your notes in the cloud!
