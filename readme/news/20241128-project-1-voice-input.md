# Project 1: Making voice typing even better for everyone

Joplin is partnering with a French government institution to bring you innovative new features! We will work on accessibility, voice typing, HTR and add Rocketbook integration. Today we'll present the planned improvements to voice typing:

Right now, voice input works pretty well, but there’s one thing that still needs improvement: punctuation. Our current system is accurate, but it doesn’t pick up on things like commas or periods, which can make spoken text harder to understand. That’s why we’re looking into other voice recognition engines that can handle punctuation better while keeping the accuracy we need.

Improving voice input like this isn’t just about convenience – it’s about making our app more accessible to everyone. For people with visual impairments, being able to use voice input means they don’t have to rely on typing. Those with motor difficulties can control the app without needing to use their hands. And for users with dyslexia or other learning challenges, voice input can be much easier and more natural than typing out words.

We’re excited to experiment with this new feature, knowing it could make a real difference for people who rely on voice technology to get things done.
