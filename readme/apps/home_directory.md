# Home directory

Joplin stores some data in your home directory, such as your profile and certain files like crash reports. This directory will be in a location that depends on your operating system:

| Operating System | Path | Environment Variable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `C:\\Users\\(username)` | `%UserProfile%` |
| Linux | `/home/(username)` | `$HOME` |
| macOS | `/Users/(Username)` | `$HOME` |
