# Link to note

To create a link to a note, you have two options:

## Create a Markdown link

Simply create the link in Markdown, as described in the [Markdown guide](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/markdown/#links-to-other-notes).

## Use the "Link to note" dialog

An easier way is to use the "Link to note" dialog - to do so open the dialog from **Tools => Link to note...**. Then type the note you would like to link to and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> when done.

This will create a new link and insert it into your current note.
