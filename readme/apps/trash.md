# About the trash feature

When a note is deleted it is moved to the trash.

When a note is restored, it is moved back to its original notebook. If it no longer exists, the note is moved instead at the root of the note collection. It means that to see it you will need to go to "All notes" at the top of the sidebar.

When a notebook is restored, its content including sub-notebooks and notes is restored too.
