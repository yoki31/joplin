# Joplin for students

Joplin is a great tool to keep your coursework and assignments organised and accessible. Here's some ideas how Joplin can be useful to students:

## 1\. Keep your notes organised in notebooks

Store in Joplin all the information, coursework, class notes and other important resources that you gather throughout the school year. You can keep a dedicated notebook for each class and add sub-notebooks for each topic, notes or projects you do for that class. You can then categorise notes using tags to regroup similar topics or assignments types.

Synchronise your notes across multiple devices so that you can take notes on your tablet during class, and then review them on your laptop or phone later.

## 2\. Take handwritten notes

For students who prefer the traditional feel of handwriting, Joplin offers robust support for handwritten notes. Using a stylus on a tablet or touchscreen device, students can seamlessly integrate their handwritten notes into Joplin. This feature is perfect for capturing complex diagrams, equations, and sketches that are often difficult to type out.

## 3\. Manage task lists, to-dos and reminders

Joplin is an excellent tool for managing task lists, to-dos, and reminders, helping students stay organized and on top of their academic responsibilities. You can create detailed to-do lists with checkboxes, set reminders for upcoming deadlines, and prioritize tasks to ensure that nothing falls through the cracks. This functionality turns Joplin into a powerful personal organizer, making it easier to manage coursework, assignments, and personal tasks all in one place.

## 4\. Collaborate on group projects

Collaboration on group projects is made simple and efficient with Joplin. You can share notebooks and notes with peers, allowing for real-time updates and collective brainstorming. This shared workspace facilitates seamless communication and coordination, ensuring that all group members are on the same page. Whether itâ€™s dividing tasks, sharing research, or compiling final reports, Joplin's collaborative features help streamline the group project process.

## 5\. Multimedia support

You can add images, attachments and photos to your notes in Joplin to capture and store information from lectures or experiments. Take a full advantage of each device used, whether it's camera phone to attach photos, stylus tablet to take handwritten notes or desktop to comfortably write and edit your assignments. Thanks to synchronisation feature you can access your notes from any device of your choice, even offline.
