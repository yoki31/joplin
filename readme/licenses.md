# License information

This file summarizes the licenses of Joplin and the direct and indirect dependencies of packages in the Joplin monorepo. Many of these dependencies are used only at build time.

## Joplin's license

```
All code in this repository is licensed under the AGPL-3.0-or-later License
**unless a directory contains a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file**, in which case that
file applies to the code in that sub-directory.

For example, packages/server contains a LICENSE.md file, thus all code under the
packages/server directory is licensed under that license.

For example, packages/app-cli does NOT contain a LICENSE file, thus all code
under that directory is licensed under the default license, which is
AGPL-3.0-or-later.

                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                            Preamble
  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.
  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.
  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.
  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  0. Definitions.
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
  1. Source Code.
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.
  2. Basic Permissions.
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.
  7. Additional Terms.
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.
  8. Termination.
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
  11. Patents.
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.
  14. Revised Versions of this License.
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.
  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  16. Limitation of Liability.
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

# 4. Intellectual property and ownership

* **4.1**  All title and copyright in and to the Software (including, but not

  audio, music, text, and applets, incorporated in the Software) are owned by
  the Licensor. The Software is protected by the English copyright laws and
  international treaties. The Licensee is not allowed to incorporate any portion
  of the Software into other programs or compile any portion of it in

  assign any rights to, or license the Software in whole or in part.

  not subject to the rights of third parties. The Licensee agrees to notify the
  Licensor immediately and in writing if any third party asserts an infringement
  claim against the Licensee in connection with the Software.

* **4.4**  By submitting any content through the Software (the "Licensee's
  Content"), the Licensee grants  the Licensor unrestricted, sub-licensable,

  Content for the purposes of providing the Licensee with the Software and
  carrying out Licensor's legitimate business interests.

* **4.5** The Licensee is not permitted to remove any copyright or other
  proprietary notices and legends.

# 5. PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION

* **5.1** The Licensor does not have access in any manner to the Licensee's
  Content. Therefore, the Licensee is solely responsible for creating, keeping
  and maintaining any backup copies of any Licensee's Content or other
  information submitted to, through, or in relation to the Software.

The Parties agree to individually comply with the applicable data protection
laws pertaining to the Software.

# 6. AVAILABILITY

* **6.1**  The availability of the Software may be affected by factors, which
  the Licensor cannot reasonably control, such as bandwidth problems, equipment
  failure, acts and omissions of our third-party service providers, or *force
  majeure* events. The Licensor takes no responsibility for the unavailability
  of the Software caused by such factors.

# 7. Limitation of liability and disclaimer of warranties

* **7.1**  To the extent permitted by the applicable law, the Licensor expressly
  disclaims all warranties, express or implied, for the Software. The Licensor
  provides the Software on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
  ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
  warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. The entire risk arising out of use or
  performance of the Software remains with the Licensee.

* **7.2**  In no event shall the Licensor be liable for any damages whatsoever
  (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business
  interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss)
  arising out of the Licensee's Content, the use of or inability to use the
  Software, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
  damages.

* **7.3**  The Licensee is solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of the Software and assumes any risks associated with
  Licensee's exercise of permissions under the License.

* **7.4**  Third-party content or services are not covered by this License. The
  Licensee shall ensure Licensee's compliance with any terms set forth by the
  respective third parties at its own risk, cost and expense.  To the maximum
  extent permitted by law, the Licensor excludes any liability for any loss or
  damage resulting from the acts and omissions of such third-party service
  providers.

# 8. Governing Law AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

* 8.1  This License and any disputes arising out of or in connection with the
  License and the Software shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
  the laws of France. Unless otherwise provided by the applicable law, all
  disputes arising out of or in connection with the License shall be submitted
  to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in London, the United Kingdom.

# 9. FINAL PROVISIONS

* **9.1**  **Indemnification.** The Licensee shall indemnify the Licensor at
  Licensee's expense if any claims are asserted by a third party against the
  Licensor by reason of Licensee's misconduct or breach of any terms of the
  License, including failed adherence by the Licensee with any applicable laws,
  including, whether express or implied.

* **9.2**  **Severability.** The unenforceability of any single provision of
  this License shall not affect any other provision hereof. Where such a
  provision is held to be unenforceable, the Parties shall use their best
  endeavours to negotiate and agree upon an enforceable provision, which
  achieves, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, legal and commercial
  objectives of the unenforceable provision.

* **9.3**  **Waiver.** A failure of either Party to enforce strictly a provision
  of this License shall in no event be considered a waiver of any part of such
  provision. No waiver by either Party of any breach or default by the other
  party shall operate as a waiver of any succeeding breach or other default or
  breach by such other Party. No waiver shall have any effect unless it is
  specific, irrevocable and in writing.

* **9.4**  **Term and termination.** The License shall commence upon Licensee's
  access to the Software and continue until terminated by the Licensor. Upon
  termination of the License, the Licensee agrees to (i) stop all access and use
  of the Software and (ii) destroy all copies of the Software and all its
  component parts (if any) stored on the Devices. The provisions of the License
  that, by their nature, continue and survive will survive any termination of
  the License.

* **9.5**  **Amendments.** The Licensor reserves the right, at its sole
  discretion, to change or modify this License at any time by sending a prior
  notification to the Licensee (if the contact details of the Licensee are
  available to the Licensor).  Any modifications to the License shall become
  effective on the date indicated at the top of the amended License.  By
  continuing to use the Software after the date on which the modifications were
  communicated, the Licensee agrees to be bound by the modified License.  The
  Licensor reserves the right to change or discontinue the Software and any
  feature thereof with or without a prior notice to the Licensee.

* **9.6**  **Entire agreement.**  This License constitutes the entire
  understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter thereof
  and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations and discussions between the
  Parties relating thereto.

* **9.7**  **Transfer of rights.** The Licensee is not allowed to assign
  Licensee's rights under the License. The Licensor is entitled to transfer its
  rights and obligations under the License entirely or partially to a third
  party by giving a prior notice to the Licensee. If the Licensee does not agree
  to the transfer, the Licensee can terminate this License by ceasing to use the
  Software.

* **9.8**  **Contact.** For general enquiries and commercial licenses to use the
  Software, please contact the Licensor directly.

**MIT**:

# MagiCLI

Automagically generates command-line interfaces (CLI), for any module.
Just `require('magicli')();` and your module is ready to be run via CLI.

The goal is to have any module prepared to be installed globally `-g` and to be run via CLI, with no efforts. Follow these 3 steps and you are done:

 * `npm install magicli --save`
 * Add the property `bin` to your package.json with the value `./bin/cli.js`
 * Create the file `./bin/cli.js` with the following content:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

require('magicli')();
```

**That's it!** Install your module with `-g` and run it with `--help`. In the same way you can just run `node ./bin/cli.js --help` to test it quickly, without install.

## How it works

Let's suppose that `your-module` exports the function:

```javascript
module.exports = function(param1, param2) {
    return param1 + param2;
}
```

When calling it via CLI, the program will be expecting the parameters names as options. It doesn't need to follow the same order as defined in the function. Example:

```bash
$ your-module --param2="K" --param1="Z"
```
It will work with any kind of function declaration, e.g.:
```javascript
// An Arrow function with Destructuring assignment and Default values
const fn = ([param1, [param2]] = ['z', ['k']], { param3 }) => {};
module.exports = fn;
```

# object-to-arguments

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/DiegoZoracKy/object-to-arguments.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DiegoZoracKy/object-to-arguments) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/object-to-arguments.svg)]() [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/object-to-arguments.svg)]()

Transforms object's properties into an array of arguments tailored for a specific function, respecting the expected **order** and handling **destructuring** and **rest** parameters when needed.

## Installation

```bash
npm install object-to-arguments
```

**CLI**
```bash
npm install object-to-arguments -g
```

## Usage

`objectToArguments.call(fn, object);`


`objectToArguments.call(fn, object);`

 * **fn** must be a *function* reference or a function stringified (e.g. `fn.toString()`) for which the arguments array will be created for.

 * **object** is a flat *object literal* containing all the parameters names and its desired arguments. Note that in case of destructuring parameters, the object must still be flat, and the engine will create the structure needed for it.
 	* Every argument defined that is not expected as a parameter will be appended to the end of the arguments array (it will be available to be accessed via *arguments* or via rest parameter *...args*)

## Example

```javascript
const objectToArguments = require('object-to-arguments');

const fn = (a = 'defaultA', b, ...args) => {
	return { a, b, args};
};

const objectArgs = {
	extra1: 'EXTRA1',
	b: 'argB',
	extra2: 'EXTRA2'
};

// fnArguments = [ undefined, 'argB', 'EXTRA1', 'EXTRA2' ]
const fnArguments = objectToArguments(fn, objectArgs);

// fnReturn = { a: 'defaultA', b: 'argB', args: [ 'EXTRA1', 'EXTRA2' ] }
const fnReturn = fn(...fnArguments);
```

**An example with complex *destructuring parameters* and *default values* set in many ways**

```javascript
const objectToArguments = require('object-to-arguments');

const fn = function([a, [b, [c, [d,e] = ['dD', 'dE'] ]]] = ['dA', ['dB', ['dC', ]]], {f} = {}, {g = 'dG'} = {}, {h: {i} = {}} = {},{j: {k = 'dK'} = {}} = {},{l: {m, n: {o} = {}} = {}} = {}, {p,q = 'dQ', r} = {}, [[[s,{t: {u} = {}} = {}]]] = [[[]]], {v: [{w} = {}, x = 'dX'] = []} = {}) {
	return { a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i, k, m, o, p, q, r, s, u, w, x, arguments };
};

const objectArgs = {
	a: 'aA',
	b: 'aB',
	c: 'aC',
	f: 'aF',
	k: 'aK',
	p: 'aP',
	q: 'aQ',
	s: 'aS',
	u: 'aU',
	v: 'aV',
	w: 'aW',
	x: 'aX',
	extra1: 'EXTRA1',
	extra2: 'EXTRA2'
};

const fnArgs = objectToArguments(fn, objectArgs);
const fnReturn = fn(...fnArgs);

free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

1. Definitions.

   "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
   and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

   "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
   the copyright owner that is granting the License.

   "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all

   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etcâ¦
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) â [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) â undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance

This module is a thin wrapper around the base `http.Agent` class.

It provides an abstract class that must define a `connect()` function,
which is responsible for creating the underlying socket that the HTTP
client requests will use.

The `connect()` function may return an arbitrary `Duplex` stream, or
another `http.Agent` instance to delegate the request to, and may be
asynchronous (by defining an `async` function).

Instances of this agent can be used with the `http` and `https`
modules. To differentiate, the options parameter in the `connect()`
function includes a `secureEndpoint` property, which can be checked
to determine what type of socket should be returned.

#### Some subclasses:

Here are some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.

 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS

Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` or `tls.Socket`
based on the `secureEndpoint` property. This agent can be used with both
the `http` and `https` modules.

```ts
import * as net from 'net';
import * as tls from 'tls';
import * as http from 'http';
import { Agent } from 'agent-base';

class MyAgent extends Agent {
  connect(req, opts) {
    // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the "https" module
    if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
      return tls.connect(opts);
    } else {
      return net.connect(opts);
    }
  }
});

// Keep alive enabled means that `connect()` will only be
// invoked when a new connection needs to be created
const agent = new MyAgent({ keepAlive: true });

// Pass the `agent` option when creating the HTTP request
http.get('http://nodejs.org/api/', { agent }, (res) => {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

## Installation

```bash
yarn add ansi-fragments
```

## Usage

```js
import { color, modifier, pad, container } from 'ansi-fragments';

const prettyLog = (level, message) => container(
  color('green', modifier('italic', level)),
  pad(1),
  message
).build();

console.log(prettyLog('success', 'Yay!'));
```

## API

Each fragment implements `IFragment` interface:

```ts
interface IFragment {
  build(): string;
}
```

The `build` method is responsible for traversing the tree of fragments and create a string representation with ANSI escape codes.


#### `color`

```ts
color(
  ansiColor: AnsiColor,
  ...children: Array<string | IFragment>
): IFragment
```

Creates fragment for standard ANSI [colors](./src/fragments/Color.ts).

```js
color('red', 'Oh no');
color('bgBlue', color('brightBlue', 'Hey'));
color('green', modifier('bold', 'Sup!'));
```

#### `modifier`

```ts
modifier(
  ansiModifier: AnsiModifier,
  ...children: Array<string | IFragment>
): IFragment
```

Creates fragment for standard ANSI [modifiers](./src/fragments/Modifier.ts): `dim`, `bold`, `hidden`, `italic`, `underline`, `strikethrough`.

```js
modifier('underline', 'Hello', 'World');
modifier('italic', modifier('bold', 'Hey'));
modifier('bold', color('green', 'Sup!'));
```

#### `container`

```ts
container(...children: Array<string | IFragment>): IFragment
```

Creates fragment, which sole purpose is to hold and build nested fragments.

```js
container(
  color('gray', '[08/01/18 12:00]'),
  pad(1),
  color('green', 'success'),
  pad(1),
  'Some message'
)
```

#### `pad`

```ts
pad(count: number, separator?: string): IFragment
```

Creates fragment, which repeats given separator (default: ` `) given number of times.

```js
pad(1);
pad(2, '#')
pad(1, '\n')
```

#### `fixed`

```ts
fixed(
  value: number,
  bias: 'start' | 'end',
  ...children: Array<string | IFragment>
): IFragment
```

Creates fragment, which makes sure the children will always build to given number of non-ANSI characters. It will either trim the results or add necessary amount of spaces. The `bias` control if trimming/padding should be done at the start of the string representing built children or at the end.

```js
fixed(5, 'start', 'ERR'); // => '  ERR'
fixed(8, 'end', color('green', 'success')); // equals to color('green', 'success') + ' '
fixed(10, 'end', 'Hello', pad(2), 'World') // => 'Hello  Wor'
```

#### `ifElse`

```ts
ifElse(
  condition: Condition,
  ifTrueFragment: string | IFragment,
  elseFragment: string | IFragment
): IFragment

type ConditionValue = boolean | string | number | null | undefined;
type Condition = ConditionValue | (() => ConditionValue);
```

Change the output based on condition. Condition can ba a primitive value, which can be casted to boolean or a function. If conation or return value of condition is evaluated to `true`, the first argument - `ifTrueFragment` will be used, otherwise `elseFragment`.

```js
let condition = getConditionValue()
ifElse(
  () => condition,
  color('red', 'ERROR'),
  color('yellow', 'WARNING')
)
```

#### `provide`

```ts
provide<T>(
  value: T,
  builder: (value: T) => string | IFragment
): IFragment
```

Provides given value to a builder function, which should return `string` or fragment. Useful in situations when the output is connected with some calculated value - using `provide` you only need to calculate final value once and forward it to custom styling logic.

```js
provide(getMessageFromSomewhere(), value => {
  switch (value.level) {
    case 'error':
      return container(
        color('red', modifier('bold', value.level.toUpperCase())),
        pad(2),
        value.log
      );
    case 'info':
      return container(
        color('blue', value.level.toUpperCase()),
        pad(2),
        value.log
      );
    default:
      return container(value.level.toUpperCase(), pad(2), value.log);
  }
})
```

A node.js library to get paths to directories to store configs, caches and data according to OS standarts.

## Installation

```sh
npm install appdirsjs
```

or

```sh
yarn install appdirsjs
```

if you're using yarn.

## Usage

```javascript
import appDirs from "appdirsjs";

const dirs = appDirs({ appName: "expo" });

console.log(dirs.cache);
// /home/user/.cache/expo on Linux
// /Users/User/Library/Caches/expo on MacOS
// C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\expo on Windows

console.log(dirs.config);
// /home/user/.config/expo on Linux
// /Users/User/Library/Preferences/expo on MacOS
// C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\expo

console.log(dirs.data);
// /home/user/.local/share/expo on Linux
// /Users/User/Library/Application Support/expo on MacOS
// C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\expo
```

### Keep backward compability

Then switching from old-style dotfile directory,
such as `~/.myapp` to new, like `~/.config/myapp`,
you can pass `legacyPath` parameter
to keep using old directory if it exists:

```javascript
import * as path from "path";
import appDirs from "appdirsjs";

const dirs = appDirs({
  appName: "expo",
  // Notice usage of full path
  legacyPath: path.join(os.homedir(), ".expo"),
});

console.log(dirs.config);
// /home/user/.expo
```

From https://github.com/nodeca/argparse.

**Python-2.0**:

```
A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

# Introduction

While Node.js has built-in support for Base64 data, it does not come with the ability to encode / decode data in a stream.

This library contains a streaming Base64 encoder and a streaming Base64 decoder for use with Node.js. These classes are written using the Node.js [stream interfaces](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) and are well covered with unit tests.

# Usage

## Installation

To install base64-stream

    npm install base64-stream
    
## Examples
This example encodes an image and pipes it to stdout.

```javascript
var http = require('http');
var {Base64Encode} = require('base64-stream');

var img = 'http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2433/3973241798_86ddfa642b_o.jpg';
http.get(img, function(res) {
    if (res.statusCode === 200)
        res.pipe(new Base64Encode()).pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

This example takes in Base64 encoded data on stdin, decodes it, an pipes it to stdout.
```javascript
var {Base64Encode} = require('base64-stream');
process.stdin.pipe(new Base64Encode()).pipe(process.stdout);
```

## options:

`Base64Encode` can take an optional object `{lineLength: number, prefix: string}`  
The prefix is useful for prepending for example `data:image/png;base64,` to make a base64 URL.  
This example proxies an image url, and send the base64 string in response.

```
app.get('/i/*', function(req, res){ // using express for example
	fetch(req.params[0]) // using node-fetch
	.then(r=>r.body.pipe(new Base64Encode({prefix:`data:${r.headers.get('content-type')};base64,`})).pipe(res))
	.catch(console.error);
});
```

# Requirements

This module currently requires Node 6.0.0 or higher.

# Testing

To run the unit tests

    npm test

# License

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
     for the public:

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

# CLIss

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/DiegoZoracKy/cliss.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DiegoZoracKy/cliss) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cliss.svg)]() [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/cliss.svg)]()

CLI Simple, Stupid. Automatic discovery of parameters names and support to subcommands down to N levels. Provides an easy and minimal setup by passing in only a function reference without the need of declaring all expected options names or create a help section by hand.

## Goals

 * Simple and easy API
 * Easy minimal setup, extracting options names from functions parameters
 * Out of the box support to sync or async (Promise) functions
 * Subcommands down to N levels
 * Automatic Help section generation, that can be improved only when needed

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install cliss
```

## Usage

Through this section we'll be going from the most minimal usage of the module, where options names are extracted from functions parameters:
```javascript
const func = (param1, param2) => `${param1}_${param2}`;
cliss(func);
```

to a version using all the possible options it provides:

```javascript
const cliSpec = {
	name,
	description,
	version,
	options: [{
		name,
		description,
		required,
		type
	}],
	pipe: {
		stdin: (stdinValue, args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {},
		before: (args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {},
		after: (result, parsedArgs, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {}
	},
	action: () => {},
	commands: [{}]
};

const clissOptions = {
	command: {
		subcommandsDelimiter
	},
	options: {
		validateRequiredParameters
	},
	version: {
		option
	},
	help: {
		option,
		stripAnsi
	},
	pipe: {
		stdin: (stdinValue, args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {},
		before: (args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {},
		after: (result, parsedArgs, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {}
	}
};

cliss(cliSpec, clissOptions);
```

### A CLI for a function (the most simple and minimal use case)
`cliss(functionReference)`

Creating a CLI for a function by doing nothing more than passing it as a parameter to cliss. The options names will be the same as the parameters expected by the function.

```javascript
'use strict';
const cliss = require('cliss');

const aFunctionWithWeirdParametersDefinition = (param1, param2, { someProp: [[ param3 ]] = [[]] } = {}, ...args) => {
	let result = `param1: ${param1} \n`;
	result += `param2: ${param2} \n`;
	result += `param3: ${param3} \n`;
	result += `args: ${args.join(',')}`;

	return result;Run the program passing with the following options:


};

cliss(aFunctionWithWeirdParametersDefinition);
```
Calling it via CLI with `--help` will give you:

```bash
Options:

  --param1
  --param2
  --param3
  --args
```

Passing in the options:
`node cli.js --param2=PARAM2 --param1=PARAM1 --param3=PARAM3 --args=a --args=r --args=g --args=s`

Or passing options + arguments (arguments for the "...args" parameter in this case):
`node cli.js --param2=PARAM2 --param1=PARAM1 --param3=PARAM3 a r g s`

Will result in:

```bash
param1: PARAM1
param2: PARAM2
param3: PARAM3
args: a,r,g,s
```
Note that the order of the options doesn't need to match the order of the parameters.

### Improving the help section
`cliss(cliSpec)`

Great, but probably one would like to improve a bit the `--help` section of the module, by providing to the end user the **name** (the command's name for calling it via CLI), **description** and **version** of the module. In this case a *Object Literal* will be used instead of just a function reference.

```javascript
'use strict';
const cliss = require('../');

cliss({
	name: 'some-command',
	description: 'Just an example that will do nothing but concat all the parameters.',
	version: '1.0.0',
	action: (param1, param2, { someProp: [[ param3 ]] = [[]] } = {}, ...args) => {
		let result = `param1: ${param1} \n`;
		result += `param2: ${param2} \n`;
		result += `param3: ${param3} \n`;
		result += `args: ${args.join(',')}`;

		return result;
	}
});
```

Now, when calling it with `--help`, a better help section will be shown:

```bash
Description:

  Just an example that will do nothing but concat all the parameters.

Usage:

  $ some-command  [options] [args...]

Options:

  --param1
  --param2
  --param3
  --args
```

### Providing more information about the expected options
`cliss(cliSpec)`

The options were effortlessly extracted from the parameters names, but **cliss** provides a way for one to provide more information about each of them. The *Object Literal* passed in the *cliSpec* parameter can have a property named **options**, which expects an *Array* of objects, containing the **name** of the option plus some of the following properties:

* **required**
To tell if the parameter is required.

* **description**
To give hints or explain what the option is about.

* **type**
To define how the parser should treat the option (Array, Object, String, Number, etc.). Check [yargs-parser](https://github.com/yargs/yargs-parser) for instructions about *type*, as it is the engine being used to parse the options.

* **alias**
To define an alias for the option.

Following the last example, let's improve it to:
 * give more information about **param1**
 * check **args** as required

```javascript
cliss({
	name: 'some-command',
	description: 'Just an example that will do nothing but concat all the parameters.',
	version: '1.0.0',
	options: [{
		name: 'param1',
		description: 'This param is the base value to compute everything else.',
		required: true,
		type: 'String'
	}, {
		name: 'args',
		required: true
	}],
	action: (param1, param2, { someProp: [[ param3 ]] = [[]] } = {}, ...args) => {
		let result = `param1: ${param1} \n`;
		result += `param2: ${param2} \n`;
		result += `param3: ${param3} \n`;
		result += `args: ${args.join(',')}`;

		return result;
	}
});
```

Call `--help`, and note that the *Usage* section will also be affected. Now *[options] [args...]* will be shown as *<options> <args...>*, because both of them are required.

```bash
Description:

  Just an example that will do nothing but logging all the parameters.

Usage:

  $ some-command  <options> <args...>

Options:

  --param1 String   Required - This param is the base value to compute
                    everything else.
  --param2
  --param3
  --args            Required
```

Run the program with the following options:
`node cli.js --param1=001 --param2=002 --param3=PARAM3 a r g s`

And check the result to see how *param1* was indeed treated as a string, while *param2* was parsed as a number:

```bash
param1: 001
param2: 2
param3: PARAM3
args: a,r,g,s
```

### Pipe: STDIN, Before and After
`cliss(cliSpec)`

A property named **pipe** can also be defined on *cliSpec* in order to handle **stdin** and also, some steps of the execution flow (**before** and **after**). To define a single handle for all the commands, the **pipe** option can be defined on [Cliss options](#cliss-options) as will be shown later on the documentation. The pipeline execution of a command is:

**stdin** *(command.pipe.stdin || clissOptions.pipe.stdin)* =>
=> **clissOptions.pipe.before** =>
=> **command.pipe.before** =>
=> **command.action** =>
=> **command.pipe.after** =>
=> **clissOptions.pipe.after**
=> **stdout**

Where each of these steps can be handled if needed.

The properties expected by **pipe** are:

* **stdin**
`(stdinValue, args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions)`

* **before**
`(args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions)`
To transform the data being input, before it is passed in to the main command action.

* **after**
`(result, parsedArgs, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions)`
To transform the *output* (for example, to JSON.stringify an *Object Literal*)

Note: **stdin** and **before** must always return *args*, and **after** must always return *result*, as these values will be passed in for the next function in the pipeline.

To better explain with an example, let's modify the previous one to:

* get *param3* from **stdin**
* use **before** to reverse *...args* array
* use **after** to decorate the output

Check the *pipe* property on the following code:

```javascript
cliss({
	name: 'some-command',
	description: 'Just an example that will do nothing but concat all the parameters.',
	version: '1.0.0',
	options: [{
		name: 'param1',
		description: 'This param is needed to compute everything else.',
		required: true,
		type: 'String'
	}, {
		name: 'args',
		required: true
	}],
	pipe: {
		stdin: (stdinValue, args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {
			args.param3 = stdinValue;
			return args;
		},
		before: (args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {
			positionalArgs.reverse();
			return args;
		},
		after: (result, parsedArgs, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {
			return `======\n${result}\n======`;
		}
	},
	action: (param1, param2, { someProp: [[ param3 ]] = [[]] } = {}, ...args) => {
		let result = `param1: ${param1} \n`;
		result += `param2: ${param2} \n`;
		result += `param3: ${param3} \n`;
		result += `args: ${args.join(',')}`;

		return result;
	}
});
```

Calling it as:
`echo "fromSTDIN" | node cli.js --param1=001 --param2=002 a r g s`

Will result in:

```bash
=======
param1: 001
param2: 2
param3: fromSTDIN
args: s,g,r,a
=======
```

### Subcommands

Subcommands can be defined in a very simple way. Thinking naturally, a subcommand should be just a command that comes nested into another one, and it is exactly how it's done.

Here one more property of the *cliSpec* is introduced: **commands**. It is an *Array* that can contains N commands, including the **commands** property (commands can be nested down to N levels).

As each subcommand is a command itself, they also counts with its own `--help` section, and possibly its own `--version` (if it is not defined for a subcommand, the one defined for the root will be shown).

The following example will introduce:

* 1 subcommand, thas has no action, and contains more 2 subcommands
* 1 subcommand that contains an action

```javascript
cliss({
	name: 'some-command',
	description: 'Just an example that will do nothing but concat all the parameters.',
	version: '1.0.0',
	options: [{
		name: 'param1',
		description: 'This param is the base value to compute everything else.',
		required: true,
		type: 'String'
	}, {
		name: 'args',
		required: true
	}],
	pipe: {
		stdin: (stdinValue, args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {
			args.param3 = stdinValue;
			return args;
		},
		before: (args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {
			positionalArgs.reverse();
			return args;
		},
		after: (result, parsedArgs, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {
			return `======\n${result}\n======`;
		}
	},
	action: (param1, param2, { someProp: [[ param3 ]] = [[]] } = {}, ...args) => {
		let result = `param1: ${param1} \n`;
		result += `param2: ${param2} \n`;
		result += `param3: ${param3} \n`;
		result += `args: ${args.join(',')}`;

		return result;
	},
	commands: [{
		name: 'subcommand1',
		commands: [{
			name: 'action1',
			options: [{
				name: 'param',
				required: true
			}],
			action: param => `subcommand1 action1 param: ${param}`
		}, {
			name: 'action2',
			action: () => 'subcommand1 action2'
		}]
	}, {
		name: 'subcommand2',
		action: () => console.log('subcommand2')
	}]
});
```

Call `--help` to see that a new section *Commands:* is presented:

```bash
Description:

  Just an example that will do nothing but concat all the parameters.

Usage:

  $ some-command  <options> <args...>
  $ some-command  [command]

Options:

  --param1 String   Required - This param is needed to compute
                    everything else.
  --param2
  --param3
  --args            Required

Commands:

  subcommand1
  subcommand2
```

Each subcomand has its own help section, check:
`node cli.js subcommand1 --help`

```bash
Usage:

  $ some-command subcommand1
```

`node cli.js subcommand2 --help`:

```bash
Usage:

  $ some-command subcommand2 <command>

Commands:

  action1
  action2
```

Just call the commands names separated by space:
`node cli.js subcommand2 action1 --param=VALUE`

Result:

```bash
subcommand2 action1 param: VALUE
```

### Cliss options
`cliss(cliSpec, clissOptions)`

An `Object Literal` with the following options can be passed in as the second parameter to cliss:

* **command**

  * **subcommandsDelimiter**
  To define a delimiter for a subcommand to be used instead of a white space. For example, if `'-'` is passed in, the subcommands should be called as `subcommand1-action1` instead of `subcommand1 action1`.

* **options**

  * **validateRequiredParameters**
  If set to `true`, the required parameters will be checked before the command action is called, and the help section will be shown in case a required parameter is missing.

* **help**
  * **option**
  	To define a different option name to show the help section. For example, if `'helpsection'` is passed in, `--helpsection` must be used instead of `--help`.

  * **stripAnsi**
  	Set to `true` to strip all ansi escape codes (colors, underline, etc.) and output just a raw text.

* **version**
  * **option**
  To define a different option name to show the version. For example, if `'moduleversion'` is passed in, `--moduleversion` must be used instead of `--version`.

* **pipe**
As it is defined on *cliSpec* for each command, **pipe** can also be defined in *clissOptions* to implement for all commands a unique way to handle **stdin** and also, some steps of the execution flow (**before** and **after**) in case it is needed. The pipeline execution of a command is:
**stdin** *(command.pipe.stdin || clissOptions.pipe.stdin)* =>
=> **clissOptions.pipe.before** =>
=> **command.pipe.before** =>
=> **command.action** =>
=> **command.pipe.after** =>
=> **clissOptions.pipe.after**
=> **stdout**
The properties expected by **pipe** are:

  * **stdin**
`(stdinValue, args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions)`

  * **before**
`(args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions)`
To transform the data being input, before it is passed in to the main command action.

  * **after**
`(result, parsedArgs, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions)`
To transform the *output* (for example, to JSON.stringify an *Object Literal*)

Note: **stdin** and **before** must always return *args*, and **after** must always return *result*, as these values will be passed in for the next function in the pipeline.

  Event emitter component.

## Installation

```
$ component install component/emitter
```

## API

### Emitter(obj)

  The `Emitter` may also be used as a mixin. For example
  a "plain" object may become an emitter, or you may
  extend an existing prototype.

  As an `Emitter` instance:

```js
var Emitter = require('emitter');
var emitter = new Emitter;
emitter.emit('something');
```

  As a mixin:

```js
var Emitter = require('emitter');
var user = { name: 'tobi' };
Emitter(user);

user.emit('im a user');
```

  As a prototype mixin:

```js
var Emitter = require('emitter');
Emitter(User.prototype);
```

### Emitter#on(event, fn)

  Register an `event` handler `fn`.

### Emitter#once(event, fn)

  Register a single-shot `event` handler `fn`,
  removed immediately after it is invoked the
  first time.

### Emitter#off(event, fn)

  * Pass `event` and `fn` to remove a listener.
  * Pass `event` to remove all listeners on that event.
  * Pass nothing to remove all listeners on all events.

### Emitter#emit(event, ...)

  Emit an `event` with variable option args.

### Emitter#listeners(event)

  Return an array of callbacks, or an empty array.

### Emitter#hasListeners(event)

  Check if this emitter has `event` handlers.

Node.js [Module](#module) and [CLI](http://npm.im/datauri-cli) to generate [Data URI scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme).

> The data URI scheme is a uniform resource identifier (URI) scheme that provides a way to include data in-line in web pages as if they were external resources.

from: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme)

## MODULE [![Build Status](https://github.com/data-uri/datauri/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/data-uri/datauri/actions/workflows/main.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

`npm install datauri`

### Getting started

By default, datauri module returns a promise, which is resolved with `data:uri` string or rejected with read file error:

```js
const datauri = require('datauri');

const content = await datauri('test/myfile.png');

console.log(content);
//=> "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."
```

### Callback style and meta data

```js
const datauri = require('datauri');

datauri('test/myfile.png', (err, content, meta) => {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  console.log(content); //=> "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."

  console.log(meta.mimetype); //=> "image/png"
  console.log(meta.base64); //=> "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."
  console.log(meta.buffer); //=> file buffer
});
```

### CSS parser

```js
const datauriCSS = require('datauri/css');

await datauriCSS('test/myfile.png');
//=> "\n.case {\n    background-image: url('data:image/png; base64,iVBORw..."

await datauriCSS('test/myfile.png', {
  className: 'myClass',
  width: true,
  height: true
});
//=> adds image width and height and custom class name
```

### Synchronous calls

```js
const Datauri = require('datauri/sync');
const meta = Datauri('test/myfile.png');

console.log(meta.content); //=> "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."
console.log(meta.mimetype); //=> "image/png"
console.log(meta.base64); //=> "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."
console.log(meta.buffer); //=> file buffer
```

### From a Buffer

If you already have a file Buffer, that's the way to go:

```js
const DatauriParser = require('datauri/parser');
const parser = new DatauriParser();

const buffer = fs.readFileSync('./hello');

parser.format('.png', buffer); //=> "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."
```

### From a string

```js
const DatauriParser = require('datauri/parser');
const parser = new DatauriParser();

parser.format('.png', 'xkcd'); //=> "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."
```

## Contribute

$ npm install
```

### denodeify@1.2.1

From https://github.com/matthew-andrews/denodeify.

**MIT**:


````
denodeify [ ![Codeship Status for matthew-andrews/denodeify](https://codeship.io/projects/02ac77d0-1a58-0132-bf86-4a07366ee29d/status)](https://codeship.io/projects/34622)
=========

Tool to turn functions with Node-style callback APIs into functions that return [Promises](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise).

Inspired by and adapted from Q's [`Q.denodeify`/`Q.nfcall` function](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#qnfbindnodefunc-args).

Warning: This micro-library doesn't force you to use any particular Promise implementation by using whatever `Promise` has been defined as globally.  This is so that you may use any ES6 standard Promise compliant library - or, of course, native ES6 Promises.

If you're running the code on a browser or node version that doesn't include native promises you will need to include a polyfill.  The following polyfills are tested as part of this module's test suite:-
- [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)'s [ES6 Promise library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) (which is actually adapted from [Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)'s [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js)). -  `require('es6-promise').polyfill();`
- [Getify](https://twitter.com/getify)'s [Native Promise Only library](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - `require('native-promise-only');`
- [ES6 Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim) - `require('es6-shim');`
- [Calvin Metcalf](https://twitter.com/CWMma)'s [Lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - `global.Promise = global.Promise || require('lie');`

Note: as of v1.2.0 you can use **denodeify** in the front end.  Pull it in via CommonJS, AMD or simply add to your webpage and it'll be available on `window.denodeify`. 

## Installation

```
npm install denodeify --save
```

Or:-

```
bower install denodeify --save
```

## Examples

Simple example with [`readFile`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/read-file):-

```js
require('es6-promise').polyfill();

var denodeify = require('denodeify');
var readFile = denodeify(require('fs').readFile);

readFile('my-file.txt', { encoding: 'UTF-8' })
  .then(function(text) {
    console.log("My file's contents is: " + text);
  });
```

(Note: you will need to also install [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) with `npm install es6-promise` for this code sample to work within node versions that don't have `Promise` natively available)

More complex example with `exec`:-

## Advanced usage

You can also pass in a function as a second argument of `denodeify` that allows you to manipulate the data returned by the wrapped function before it gets passed to the Promise's `reject` or `resolve` functions, for example:-

```js
require('es6-promise').polyfill();

var denodeify = require('denodeify');
var exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {

  // Throw away stderr data
  return [err, stdout];
});

exec('hostname')
  .then(function(host) {
    console.log("My hostname is: " + host.replace('\n', ''));
  });
```

Or,

```js
require('es6-promise').polyfill();

var denodeify = require('denodeify');
var exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {
  return [err, [stdout, stderr]];
});

exec('my-command')
  .then(function(results) {
    console.log("stdout is: " + results[0]);
    console.log("stderr is: " + results[1]);
  });
```

Useful for functions that return multiple arguments, for example [`child_process#exec`](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).

## Credits and collaboration ##

The lead developer of **denodeify** is [Matt Andrews](http://twitter.com/andrewsmatt) at FT Labs with much help and support from [Kornel LesiÅski](https://twitter.com/pornelski). All open source code released by FT Labs is licenced under the MIT licence. We welcome comments, feedback and suggestions.  Please feel free to raise an issue or pull request.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as

     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
        or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third partyâs
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipientsâ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipientsâ
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an âas isâ basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   partyâs negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a partyâs ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With

# Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE (âAGREEMENTâ). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

## 1. DEFINITIONS

âContributionâ means:

-   a\) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
    Distributed under this Agreement, and
-   b\) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
    -   i\) changes to the Program, and
    -   ii\) additions to the Program;

    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
    and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
    âoriginatesâ from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
    such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
    behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the
    Program that are not Modified Works.

âContributorâ means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

âLicensed Patentsâ mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
or when combined with the Program.

âProgramâ means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

âRecipientâ means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

âDerivative Worksâ shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

âModified Worksâ shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
or Modified Works thereof.

âDistributeâ means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in
any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

âSource Codeâ means the form of a Program preferred for making
modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
documentation source, and configuration files.

âSecondary Licenseâ means either the GNU General Public License, Version
2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or
additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.

## 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

-   a\) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
    license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
    publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
    Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
-   b\) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
    under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
    otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in
    Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the
    combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
    Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
    Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
    Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
    combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
    licensed hereunder.
-   c\) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
    secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
    to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
    that license before distributing the Program.
-   d\) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
    license set forth in this Agreement.
-   e\) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor
    makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in
    this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program
    under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of
    Section 3).

## 3. REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

-   a\) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance
    with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a
    statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this
    Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange;
    and
-   b\) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different
    than this Agreement, provided that such license:
    -   i\) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
    -   ii\) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental
        and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
    -   iii\) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the
        Source Code under section 3.2; and
    -   iv\) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to
        be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.

3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

-   a\) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i)
    is combined with other material in a separate file or files made
    available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor
    attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this
    Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of
    such Secondary Licenses, and
-   b\) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
    the Program.

3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
of liability (ânoticesâ) contained within the Program from any copy of
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
their own appropriate notices.

## 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in
a commercial product offering, such Contributor (âCommercial
Contributorâ) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor (âIndemnified Contributorâ) against any losses, damages and
costs (collectively âLossesâ) arising from claims, lawsuits and other
legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
must pay those damages.

## 5. NO WARRANTY {#warranty}

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN âAS ISâ
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

## 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY {#disclaimer}

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## 7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has
the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the
initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

## Exhibit A â Form of Secondary Licenses Notice {#exhibit-a}

âThis Source Code may also be made available under the following
Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth
in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.â

> Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is
> not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
>
> If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
> file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
> file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
> look for such a notice.
>
> You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
for your cryptography operations.

## Incentive

ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
even more slower.

## API

### ECDSA

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;

// Create and initialize EC context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC('secp256k1');

// Generate keys
var key = ec.genKeyPair();

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash);

// Export DER encoded signature in Array
var derSign = signature.toDER();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

var pubPoint = key.getPublic();
var x = pubPoint.getX();
var y = pubPoint.getY();

// Public Key MUST be either:
// 1) '04' + hex string of x + hex string of y; or
// 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or
// 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y)
var pub = pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1
var pub = { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2
var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3
var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3

// Import public key
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Signature MUST be either:
// 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or
// 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
// 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or
// 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)

var signature = '3046022100...'; // case 1
var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2
var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### EdDSA

```javascript
var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;

// Create and initialize EdDSA context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');

// Create key pair from secret
var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Import public key
var pub = '0a1af638...';
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Verify signature
var signature = '70bed1...';
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### ECDH

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

// Generate keys
var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();

var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());

console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances');
console.log(shared1.toString(16));
console.log(shared2.toString(16));
```

three and more members:
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

var A = ec.genKeyPair();
var B = ec.genKeyPair();
var C = ec.genKeyPair();

var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())

var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())

console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
```

NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.

## Supported curves

Elliptic.js support following curve types:

* Short Weierstrass
* Montgomery
* Edwards
* Twisted Edwards

Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:

* `secp256k1`
* `p192`
* `p224`
* `p256`
* `p384`
* `p521`
* `curve25519`
* `ed25519`

NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.

### Implementation details

ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.

All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
provided by [hash.js][2]

### Related projects

* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
  node)

Create new error instances with a code and additional properties.


## Installation

```console
$ npm install err-code
// or
$ bower install err-code
```

The browser file is named index.umd.js which supports CommonJS, AMD and globals (errCode).


## Why

I find myself doing this repeatedly:

```js
var err = new Error('My message');
err.code = 'SOMECODE';
err.detail = 'Additional information about the error';
throw err;
```


## Usage

Simple usage.

```js
var errcode = require('err-code');

// fill error with message + code
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), 'ESOMECODE');
// fill error with message + code + props
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), 'ESOMECODE', { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
// fill error with message + props
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
```

## Pre-existing fields

If the passed `Error` already has a `.code` field, or fields specified in the third argument to `errcode` they will be overwritten, unless the fields are read only or otherwise throw during assignment in which case a new object will be created that shares a prototype chain with the original `Error`. The `.stack` and `.message` properties will be carried over from the original error and `.code` or any passed properties will be set on it.


## Tests

`$ npm test`

### growly@1.3.0

From https://github.com/theabraham/growly.

**MIT**:


````
# Growly #

Simple zero-dependency Growl notifications using GNTP.

## Installation ##

Install growly using `npm`:

```
npm install growly
```

And then require it:

```javascript
var growly = require('growly');
```

This module uses the Growl Network Transport Protocol (GNTP) which was implemented in Growl since version 1.3, so you **must have an appropriate version of Growl installed** for Growly to work.

## Example ##

Sending a minimal Growl notification:

```javascript
var growly = require('growly');

growly.notify('This is as easy as it gets', { title: 'Hello, World!' });
```

More examples can be found in the *example/* directory.

## Usage ##

The growly module exposes only three methods: `Growly.register()`, `Growly.notify()`, and `Growly.setHost()`.

### Growly.register(appname, [appicon], [notifications], [callback]) ###

Registers a new application with Growl. Registration is completely optional since it will be performed automatically for you with sensible defaults. Useful if you want your application, with its own icon and types of notifications, to show up in Growl's prefence panel.

  - `appname` the name of the application (required.)
  - `appicon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for an application icon image.
  - `notifications` a list of defined notification types with the following properties:
    - `.label` name used to identify the type of notification being used (required.)
    - `.dispname` name users will see in Growl's preference panel (defaults to `.label`.)
    - `.enabled` whether or not notifications of this type are enabled (defaults to true.)
  - `callback` called when the registration completes; if registration fails, the first argument will be an Error object.

An example:

```javascript
growly.register('My Application', 'path/to/icon.png', [
    { label: 'success', dispname: 'Success' },
    { label: 'warning', dispname: 'Warning', enabled: false }
], function(err) {
    console.log(err || 'Registration successful!');
});
```

### Growly.notify(text, [opts], [callback]) ###

Sends a Growl notification. If an application wasn't registered beforehand with `growly.register()`, a default application will automatically be registered beforesending the notification.

  - `text` the body of the notification.
  - `opts` an object with the following properties:
    - `.title` title of the notification.
    - `.icon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for the notification's icon.
    - `.sticky` whether or not to sticky the notification (defaults to false.)
    - `.label` type of notification to use (defaults to the first registered notification type.)
    - `.priority` the priority of the notification from lowest (-2) to highest (2).
    - `.coalescingId` replace/update the matching previous notification. May be ignored.
  - `callback` called when the user has closed/clicked the notification. The callback is passed an Error object `err` as the first argument when the notification fails; otherwise, the second argument `action` is a string that'll describe which action has been taken by the user (either 'closed' or 'clicked'.)

An example:

```javascript
/* Assuming an application was registered with a notification type labeled 'warning'. */
growly.notify('Stuffs broken!', { label: 'warning' }, function(err, action) {
    console.log('Action:', action);
});
```

### Growly.setHost(host, port) ###

Set the host and port that Growl (GNTP) requests will be sent to. Using this method is optional since GNTP defaults to using host 'localhost' and port 23053.

http-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http` module.

__Note:__ For HTTP proxy usage with the `https` module, check out
[`node-https-proxy-agent`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent).

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install http-proxy-agent
```


Example
-------

``` js
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var HttpProxyAgent = require('http-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

http.get(opts, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});

https-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

## Usage
Get your ip address, compare ip addresses, validate ip addresses, etc.

```js
var ip = require('ip');

ip.address() // my ip address
ip.isEqual('::1', '::0:1'); // true
ip.toBuffer('127.0.0.1') // Buffer([127, 0, 0, 1])
ip.toString(new Buffer([127, 0, 0, 1])) // 127.0.0.1
ip.fromPrefixLen(24) // 255.255.255.0
ip.mask('192.168.1.134', '255.255.255.0') // 192.168.1.0
ip.cidr('192.168.1.134/26') // 192.168.1.128
ip.not('255.255.255.0') // 0.0.0.255
ip.or('192.168.1.134', '0.0.0.255') // 192.168.1.255
ip.isPrivate('127.0.0.1') // true
ip.isV4Format('127.0.0.1'); // true
ip.isV6Format('::ffff:127.0.0.1'); // true

// operate on buffers in-place
var buf = new Buffer(128);
var offset = 64;
ip.toBuffer('127.0.0.1', buf, offset);  // [127, 0, 0, 1] at offset 64
ip.toString(buf, offset, 4);            // '127.0.0.1'

This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of
authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original
Work:

Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1

e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent
claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the
Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original
Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as
long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing
the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following
the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing
in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
license.

5) This section intentionally omitted.

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work
or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt
to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by
exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging
patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or
hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 101 et
seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
make it enforceable.

in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means
(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
entity.

# MagiCLI

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/DiegoZoracKy/magicli.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DiegoZoracKy/magicli) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/magicli.svg)]() [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/magicli.svg)]()

Automagically generates command-line interfaces (CLI), for any module.
Just `require('magicli')();` and your module is ready to be executed via CLI.

The main goal is to have any module prepared to be executed via CLI (installed globally with `-g`, or by using **npx**):

## Goals

 * Minimal setup (*one line*)
 * Automatic options names based on functions parameters
 * Out of the box support to async functions (`Promises`, or any *thenable* lib)
 * A specific help section for each nested property (*"subcommands"*)
 * *Name*, *Description* and *Version* extracted from package.json
 * Simple API to hook into the execution flow (*stdin*, *before*, *after*)
 * Cover all possible cases of module.exports (*Function*, *Object* with nested properties, Destructuring parameters)

## Usage (the most simple and minimal way)

 * `npm install magicli`
 * Add the property **bin** to your package.json containing the value **./bin/magicli.js**
 * Create the file **./bin/magicli.js** with the following content:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

require('magicli')();
```

**Done!** Install your module with `-g`, or use it via **[npx](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner)**, and run it with `--help` to see the result. The `--version` option will show the same value found at *package.json*. In the same way you can just run `node ./bin/magicli.js --help` to test it quickly, without installing it.

Let's suppose that **your-module** exports the function:

```javascript
module.exports = function(param1, param2) {
    return param1 + param2;
}
```

When calling it via CLI, with `--help`, you will get:

```bash
Description:

  Same description found at package.json

Usage:

  $ your-module [options]

Options:

  --param1
  --param2
```

The program will be expecting options with the same name as the parameters declared at the exported function, and it doesn't need to follow the same order. Example:

`$ your-module --param2="K" --param1="Z"` would result in: `ZK`.

### How it works

MagiCLI is capable of handling many styles of `exports`, like:

 * Functions
 * Object Literal
 * Nested properties
 * Class with static methods

And also any kind of parameters declaration (*Destructuring Parameters*, *Rest Parameters*).

If **your-module** were like this:
```javascript
// An Arrow function with Destructuring assignment and Default values
const mainMethod = ([p1, [p2]] = ['p1Default', ['p2Default']], { p3 = 'p3Default' } = {}) => `${p1}-${p2}-${p3}`;

// Object Literal containing a nested method
module.exports = {
	mainMethod,
	nested: {
		method: param => `nested method param value is: "${param}`
	}
};
```

`$ your-module --help` would result in:

```bash
Description:

  Same description found at package.json

Usage:

  $ your-module <command>

Commands:

  mainMethod
  nested-method
```

`$ your-module mainMethod --help` would be:

```bash
Usage:

  $ your-module mainMethod [options]

Options:

  --p1
  --p2
  --p3
```

`$ your-module nested-method --help` returns:

```bash
Usage:

  $ your-module nested-method [options]

Options:

  --param
```

Calling *mainMethod* without any parameter:
`$ your-module mainMethod`

results in:
` p1Default-p2Default-p3Default`

While defining the parameter for *nested-method*:
`$ your-module mainMethod nested-method --param=paramValue`

would return:
` nested method param value is: "paramValue"`

Note: Nested methods/properties will be turned into commands separated by `-`, and it can be configurable via options (`subcommandDelimiter`).

## Usage Options
`magicli({ commands = {}, validateRequiredParameters = false, help = {}, version = {}, pipe = {}, enumerability = 'enumerable', subcommandDelimiter = '-'})`

Options are provided to add more information about commands and its options, and also to support a better control of a command execution flow, without the need to change the source code of the module itself (for example, to `JSON.stringify` an `Object Literal` that is returned).



### enumerability

By default, only the enumerable nested properties will be considered. The possible values are: `'enumerable'` (default), `'nonenumerable'` or `'all'`.

### validateRequiredParameters
MagiCLI can validate the required parameters for a command and show the help in case some of them are missing. The default value is `false`.

### help

**help.option**
To define a different option name to show the help section. For example, if `'modulehelp'` is chosen, `--modulehelp` must be used instead of `--help` to show the help section.

**help.stripAnsi**
	Set to `true` to strip all ansi escape codes (colors, underline, etc.) and output just a raw text.



### version
**version.option**
To define a different option name to show the version. For example, if `'moduleversion'` is chosen, `--moduleversion` must be used instead of `--version` to show the version number.

### pipe (stdin, before and after)

The pipeline of a command execution is:

**stdin** (command.pipe.stdin || magicliOptions.pipe.stdin) =>

**magicliOptions.pipe.before** =>

**command.pipe.before** =>

**command.action** (the method in case) =>

**command.pipe.after** =>

**magicliOptions.pipe.after** =>

**stdout**

Where each of these steps can be handled if needed.

As it can be defined on *commands* option, for each command, **pipe** can also be defined in *options* to implement a common handler for all commands. The expected properties are:

**pipe.stdin**
`(stdinValue, args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions)`

Useful to get a value from *stdin* and set it to one of the expected *args*.

**pipe.before**
`(args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions)`

To transform the data being input, before it is passed in to the main command action.

**pipe.after**
`(result, parsedArgs, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions)`

Note: **stdin** and **before** must always return *args*, and **after** must always return *result*, as these values will be passed in for the next function in the pipeline.

### commands
The options are effortlessly extracted from the parameters names, however it is possible to give more information about a command and its options, and also give instructions to the options parser.

**commands** expects an `Object Literal` where each key is the command name. It would be the module's name for the main function that is exported, and the command's name as it is shown at the *Commands:* section of `--help`. For example:
```javascript
commands: {
    'mainmodulename': {},
    'some-nested-method': {}
}
```

For each command the following properties can be configurable:

#### options
Is an *Array* of *Objects*, where each contains:

**name** (*required*)
The name of the parameter that will be described

**required**
To tell if the parameter is required.

**description**
To give hints or explain what the option is about.

**type**
To define how the parser should treat the option (Array, Object, String, Number, etc.).  Check [yargs-parser](https://github.com/yargs/yargs-parser) for instructions about *type*, as it is the engine being used to parse the options.

**alias**
To define an alias for the option.

#### pipe (stdin, before and after)

The pipeline of a command execution is:

**stdin** (command.pipe.stdin || magicliOptions.pipe.stdin) =>

**magicliOptions.pipe.before** =>

**command.pipe.before** =>

**command.action** (the method in case) =>

**command.pipe.after** =>

**magicliOptions.pipe.after** =>

**stdout**

Where each of these steps can be handled if needed.

As it can be defined on *options* to implement a common handler for all commands, **pipe** can also be defined for each command.

**pipe.stdin**
`(stdinValue, args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions)`

Useful to get a value from *stdin* and set it to one of the expected *args*.

**pipe.before**
`(args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions)`

To transform the data being input, before it is passed in to the main command action.

**pipe.after**
`(result, parsedArgs, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions)`

Note: **stdin** and **before** must always return *args*, and **after** must always return *result*, as these values will be passed in for the next function in the pipeline.

If needed, a more thorough guide about this section can be found at [cliss](https://github.com/DiegoZoracKy/cliss) (as this is the module under the hood to handle that)

A full featured use of the module would look like:

```javascript
magicli({
	commands,
	enumerability,
	subcommandDelimiter,
	validateRequiredParameters,
	help: {
		option,
		stripAnsi
	},
	version: {
		option
	},
	pipe: {
		stdin: (stdinValue, args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {},
		before: (args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {},
		after: (result, parsedArgs, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {}
	}
});
```

## Example

To better explain with an example, let's get the following module and configure it with MagiCLI to:

 * Define **p1** as `String` (*mainMethod*)
 * Write a description for **p2** (*mainMethod*)
 * Define **p3** as required (*mainMethod*)
 * Get **p2** from stdin (*mainMethod*)
 * Use **before** (command) to upper case **param** (*nested-method*)
 * Use **after** (command) to JSON.stringify the result of (*nested-method*)
 * Use **after** (options) to decorate all outputs (*nested-method*)

**module** ("main" property of package.json)
```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = {
	mainMethod: (p1, p2, { p3 = 'p3Default' } = {}) => `${p1}-${p2}-${p3}`,
	nested: {
		method: param => {

			// Example of a Promise being handled
			return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
				setTimeout(() => {
					resolve({ param });
				}, 2000);
			});
		}
	}
};
```

**magicli.js** ("bin" property of package.json)
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node


require('../magicli')({
	commands: {
		'mainMethod': {
			options: [{
				name: 'p1',
				description: 'Number will be converted to String',
				type: 'String'
			}, {
				name: 'p2',
				description: 'This parameter can be defined via stdin'
			}, {
				name: 'p3',
				required: true
			}],
			pipe: {
				stdin: (stdinValue, args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {
					args.p2 = stdinValue;
					return args;
				}
			}
		},
		'nested-method': {
			options: [{
				name: 'param',
				description: 'Wait for it...'
			}],
			pipe: {
				before: (args, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => {
					if (args.param) {
						args.param = args.param.toUpperCase();
					}
					return args;
				},

				after: JSON.stringify
			}
		}
	},
	pipe: {
		after: (result, positionalArgs, argsAfterEndOfOptions) => `======\n${result}\n======`
	}
});
```

## Tests

There is another repository called [MagiCLI Test Machine](https://github.com/DiegoZoracKy/magicli-test-machine), where many real published modules are being successfully tested. As the idea is to keep increasing the number of real modules tested, it made more sense to maintain a separated repository for that, instead of being constantly increasing the size of MagiCLI itself over time. I ask you to contribute with the growing numbers of those tests by adding your own module there via a pull request.

If you find some case that isn't being handled properly, please open an *issue* or feel free to create a PR ;)

# markdown-it-anchor [![npm version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/markdown-it-anchor.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/markdown-it-anchor)

> Header anchors for [markdown-it].

[markdown-it]: https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it

## Usage

```js
const md = require('markdown-it')()
  .use(require('markdown-it-anchor'), opts)
```

See a [demo as JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/9ukc8dy6/).

The `opts` object can contain:

Name              | Description                                                    | Default
------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------
`level`           | Minimum level to apply anchors on or array of selected levels. | 1
`slugify`         | A custom slugification function.                               | See [`index.js`](index.js)
`permalink`       | Whether to add permalinks next to titles.                      | `false`
`renderPermalink` | A custom permalink rendering function.                         | See [`index.js`](index.js)
`permalinkClass`  | The class of the permalink anchor.                             | `header-anchor`
`permalinkSpace`  | Place space between the header text and the permalink anchor.  | `true`
`permalinkSymbol` | The symbol in the permalink anchor.                            | `Â¶`
`permalinkBefore` | Place the permalink before the title.                          | `false`
`permalinkHref`   | A custom permalink `href` rendering function.                  | See [`index.js`](index.js)
`permalinkAttrs`  | A custom permalink attributes rendering function.              | See [`index.js`](index.js)
`callback`        | Called with token and info after rendering.                    | `undefined`

The `renderPermalink` function takes the slug, an options object with
the above options, and then all the usual markdown-it rendering
arguments.

All headers above `level` will then have an `id` attribute with a slug
of their content. `level` can also be an array of headers levels to
apply the anchor, like `[2, 3]` to have an anchor on only level 2 and
3 headers.

If `permalink` is `true`, a `Â¶` symbol linking to the header itself will
be added.

You may want to use the [link symbol](http://graphemica.com/ð) as
`permalinkSymbol`, or a symbol from your favorite web font.

The `callback` option is a function that will be called at the end of
rendering with the `token` and an `info` object.  The `info` object has
`title` and `slug` properties with the token content and the slug used
for the identifier.

## User-Friendly URLs

Starting from `v5.0.0`, `markdown-it-anchor` dropped package `string`
keeping it's core value of being an unopinionated and secure library. Yet,
users looking for backward compatibility may want the old slugify:

```sh
$ npm i -S string
```

```js
const string = require('string')
const legacySlugify = s => string(s).slugify().toString()

const md = require('markdown-it')()
const anchor = require('markdown-it-anchor', {
	slugify: legacySlugify
})
```

## Unicode Support

Unicode is supported by default. Yet, if you are looking for a "prettier"
--opinionated-- link, _i.e_ without %xx, you may want to take a look at `uslug`:

```sh
$ npm i -S uslug
```

```js
const uslug = require('uslug')
const uslugify = s => uslug(s)

const md = require('markdown-it')()
const anchor = require('markdown-it-anchor', {
	slugify: uslugify
})
```

## Table of Contents

Looking for an automatic table of contents (TOC) generator? Take a look at
[markdown-it-toc-done-right](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-toc-done-right) it's
made from the ground to be a great companion of this plugin.

### mdn-data@2.0.30

From https://github.com/mdn/data.

**CC0-1.0**:

```
CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
  and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
  depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
  a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
  or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
  CC0 or use of the Work.

[micromark][] constructs that make up the core of CommonMark.
Some of these can be [turned off][disable], but they are often essential to
markdown and weird things might happen.

## Contents

*   [What is this?](#what-is-this)
*   [When should I use this?](#when-should-i-use-this)
*   [Install](#install)
*   [Use](#use)
*   [API](#api)
*   [Types](#types)
*   [Compatibility](#compatibility)
*   [Security](#security)
*   [Contribute](#contribute)
*   [License](#license)

## What is this?

This package exposes the default constructs.

## When should I use this?

This package is useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-core-commonmark
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import * as core from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-core-commonmark@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as core from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-core-commonmark@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {autolink} from 'micromark-core-commonmark'

console.log(autolink) // Do things with `autolink`.
```

## API

This module exports the following identifiers: `attention`, `autolink`,
`blankLine`, `blockQuote`, `characterEscape`, `characterReference`,
`codeFenced`, `codeIndented`, `codeText`, `content`, `definition`,
`hardBreakEscape`, `headingAtx`, `htmlFlow`, `htmlText`, `labelEnd`,
`labelStartImage`, `labelStartLink`, `lineEnding`, `list`, `setextUnderline`,
`thematicBreak`.
There is no default export.

Each identifier refers to a [construct][].

See the code for more on the exported constructs.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This package works with `micromark` version 3+.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
submit a security report.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.

This project has a [code of conduct][coc].
By interacting with this repository, organisation, or community you agree to
abide by its terms.

# Mimer [![Build Status](https://github.com/data-uri/mimer/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/data-uri/mimer/actions/workflows/main.yml?query=branch%3Amain) [![install size](https://packagephobia.com/badge?p=mimer)](https://packagephobia.com/result?p=mimer)

A file extension to [MIME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME) type module. Uses [mime-db](https://npm.im/mime-db) data but with zero dependencies.

## Getting started
`npm install mimer` or `npx mimer <file>`.

### Module
```js
const mimer = require('mimer');

mimer('.pdf'); // -> "application/pdf"
mimer('pdf'); // -> "application/pdf"
mimer('../readme.pdf'); // -> "application/pdf"
mimer('pedefe'); // -> "application/octet-stream"
```

#### Extension Map
```js
const mimer = require('mimer');
const mimerMap = require('mimer/map');

mimerMap.get('pdf'); // -> "application/pdf"
mimerMap.set('graphql', 'application/graphql');
mimer('content.graphql'); // -> "application/graphql"
```

#### Safe mode
In case you want to avoid changes on original Map for safety.
```js
const mimer = require('mimer/safe');
const mimerMap = require('mimer/map');

mimerMap.set('graphql', 'application/graphql');
mimer('content.graphql'); // -> "application/octet-stream"
```

## CLI

```sh
npm install -g mimer
mimer readme.pdf
```
or just

```sh
npx mimer readme.pdf
```

## Contribute

Just create a new Github Codespace or:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/data-uri/mimer.git
$ cd mimer
$ npm i
$ npm test

From https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge.

**(BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0)**:

```
You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the
GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
Forge project.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.

If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

# Node-RSA

Node.js RSA library<br/>
Based on jsbn library from Tom Wu http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/

* Pure JavaScript
* No needed OpenSSL
* Generating keys
* Supports long messages for encrypt/decrypt
* Signing and verifying

## Example

```javascript
const NodeRSA = require('node-rsa');
const key = new NodeRSA({b: 512});

const text = 'Hello RSA!';
const encrypted = key.encrypt(text, 'base64');
console.log('encrypted: ', encrypted);
const decrypted = key.decrypt(encrypted, 'utf8');
console.log('decrypted: ', decrypted);
```

## Installing

```shell
npm install node-rsa
```
> <sub>Requires nodejs >= 8.11.1</sub>

### Testing

```shell
npm test
```

## Work environment

This library developed and tested primary for Node.js, but it still can work in browsers with [browserify](http://browserify.org/).

## Usage

### Create instance
```javascript
const NodeRSA = require('node-rsa');

const key = new NodeRSA([keyData, [format]], [options]);
```

* keyData â `{string|buffer|object}` â parameters for generating key or the key in one of supported formats.<br/>
* format â `{string}` â format for importing key. See more details about formats in [Export/Import](#importexport-keys) section.<br/>
* options â `{object}` â additional settings.

#### Options
You can specify some options by second/third constructor argument, or over `key.setOptions()` method.

* environment â working environment (default autodetect):
    * `'browser'` â will run pure js implementation of RSA algorithms.
    * `'node'` for `nodejs >= 0.10.x or io.js >= 1.x` â provide some native methods like sign/verify and encrypt/decrypt.
* encryptionScheme â padding scheme for encrypt/decrypt. Can be `'pkcs1_oaep'` or `'pkcs1'`. Default `'pkcs1_oaep'`.
* signingScheme â scheme used for signing and verifying. Can be `'pkcs1'` or `'pss'` or 'scheme-hash' format string (eg `'pss-sha1'`). Default `'pkcs1-sha256'`, or, if chosen pss: `'pss-sha1'`.

> *Notice:* This lib supporting next hash algorithms: `'md5'`, `'ripemd160'`, `'sha1'`, `'sha256'`, `'sha512'` in browser and node environment and additional `'md4'`, `'sha'`, `'sha224'`, `'sha384'` in node only.

<sub>Some [advanced options info](https://github.com/rzcoder/node-rsa/wiki/Advanced-options)</sub>

#### Creating "empty" key
```javascript
const key = new NodeRSA();
```

#### Generate new 512bit-length key
```javascript
const key = new NodeRSA({b: 512});
```

Also you can use next method:

```javascript
key.generateKeyPair([bits], [exp]);
```

* bits â `{int}` â key size in bits. 2048 by default.
* exp â `{int}` â public exponent. 65537 by default.

#### Load key from PEM string

```javascript
const key = new NodeRSA('-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n'+
                      'MIIBOQIBAAJAVY6quuzCwyOWzymJ7C4zXjeV/232wt2ZgJZ1kHzjI73wnhQ3WQcL\n'+
                      'DFCSoi2lPUW8/zspk0qWvPdtp6Jg5Lu7hwIDAQABAkBEws9mQahZ6r1mq2zEm3D/\n'+
                      'VM9BpV//xtd6p/G+eRCYBT2qshGx42ucdgZCYJptFoW+HEx/jtzWe74yK6jGIkWJ\n'+
                      'AiEAoNAMsPqwWwTyjDZCo9iKvfIQvd3MWnmtFmjiHoPtjx0CIQCIMypAEEkZuQUi\n'+
                      'pMoreJrOlLJWdc0bfhzNAJjxsTv/8wIgQG0ZqI3GubBxu9rBOAM5EoA4VNjXVigJ\n'+
                      'QEEk1jTkp8ECIQCHhsoq90mWM/p9L5cQzLDWkTYoPI49Ji+Iemi2T5MRqwIgQl07\n'+
                      'Es+KCn25OKXR/FJ5fu6A6A+MptABL3r8SEjlpLc=\n'+
                      '-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----');
```

### Import/Export keys
```javascript
key.importKey(keyData, [format]);
key.exportKey([format]);
```

* keyData â `{string|buffer}` â may be:
    * key in PEM string 
    * Buffer containing PEM string 
    * Buffer containing DER encoded data
    * Object contains key components
* format  â `{string}` â format id for export/import.

#### Format string syntax
Format string composed of several parts: `scheme-[key_type]-[output_type]`<br/>

Scheme â NodeRSA supports multiple format schemes for import/export keys:

  * `'pkcs1'` â public key starts from `'-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----'` header and private key starts from `'-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----'` header
  * `'pkcs8'` â public key starts from `'-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----'` header and private key starts from `'-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----'` header
  * `'openssh'` â public key starts from `'ssh-rsa'` header and private key starts from `'-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----'` header
  * `'components'` â use it for import/export key from/to raw components (see example below). For private key, importing data should contain all private key components, for public key: only public exponent (`e`) and modulus (`n`). All components (except `e`) should be Buffer, `e` could be Buffer or just normal Number.     

Key type â can be `'private'` or `'public'`. Default `'private'`<br/>
Output type â can be:

 * `'pem'` â Base64 encoded string with header and footer. Used by default.
 * `'der'` â Binary encoded key data.

> *Notice:* For import, if *keyData* is PEM string or buffer containing string, you can do not specify format, but if you provide *keyData* as DER you must specify it in format string.

**Shortcuts and examples**
 * `'private'` or `'pkcs1'` or `'pkcs1-private'` == `'pkcs1-private-pem'` â private key encoded in pcks1 scheme as pem string.
 * `'public'` or `'pkcs8-public'` == `'pkcs8-public-pem'` â public key encoded in pcks8 scheme as pem string.
 * `'pkcs8'` or `'pkcs8-private'` == `'pkcs8-private-pem'` â private key encoded in pcks8 scheme as pem string.
 * `'pkcs1-der'` == `'pkcs1-private-der'` â private key encoded in pcks1 scheme as binary buffer.
 * `'pkcs8-public-der'` â public key encoded in pcks8 scheme as binary buffer.

**Code example**

```javascript
const keyData = '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- ... -----END PUBLIC KEY-----';
key.importKey(keyData, 'pkcs8');
const publicDer = key.exportKey('pkcs8-public-der');
const privateDer = key.exportKey('pkcs1-der');
```

```javascript
key.importKey({
    n: Buffer.from('0086fa9ba066685845fc03833a9699c8baefb53cfbf19052a7f10f1eaa30488cec1ceb752bdff2df9fad6c64b3498956e7dbab4035b4823c99a44cc57088a23783', 'hex'),
    e: 65537,
    d: Buffer.from('5d2f0dd982596ef781affb1cab73a77c46985c6da2aafc252cea3f4546e80f40c0e247d7d9467750ea1321cc5aa638871b3ed96d19dcc124916b0bcb296f35e1', 'hex'),
    p: Buffer.from('00c59419db615e56b9805cc45673a32d278917534804171edcf925ab1df203927f', 'hex'),
    q: Buffer.from('00aee3f86b66087abc069b8b1736e38ad6af624f7ea80e70b95f4ff2bf77cd90fd', 'hex'),
    dmp1: Buffer.from('008112f5a969fcb56f4e3a4c51a60dcdebec157ee4a7376b843487b53844e8ac85', 'hex'),
    dmq1: Buffer.from('1a7370470e0f8a4095df40922a430fe498720e03e1f70d257c3ce34202249d21', 'hex'),
    coeff: Buffer.from('00b399675e5e81506b729a777cc03026f0b2119853dfc5eb124610c0ab82999e45', 'hex')
}, 'components');
const publicComponents = key.exportKey('components-public');
console.log(publicComponents);

/*
{ n: <Buffer 00 86 fa 9b a0 66 68 58 45 fc 03 83 3a 96 99 c8 ba ef b5 3c fb f1 90 52 a7 f1 0f 1e aa 30 48 8c ec 1c eb 75 2b df f2 df 9f ad 6c 64 b3 49 89 56 e7 db ... >,
  e: 65537 
}
*/
```

If you want to only import the public key use `'components-public'` as an option:

```javascript
key.importKey({
    n: Buffer.from('0086fa9ba066685845fc03833a9699c8baefb53cfbf19052a7f10f1eaa30488cec1ceb752bdff2df9fad6c64b3498956e7dbab4035b4823c99a44cc57088a23783', 'hex'),
    e: 65537,
}, 'components-public');
```

### Properties

#### Key testing
```javascript
key.isPrivate();
key.isPublic([strict]);
```
strict â `{boolean}` â if true method will return false if key pair have private exponent. Default `false`.

```javascript
key.isEmpty();
```
Return `true` if key pair doesn't have any data.

#### Key info
```javascript
key.getKeySize();
```
Return key size in bits.

```javascript
key.getMaxMessageSize();
```
Return max data size for encrypt in bytes.

### Encrypting/decrypting

```javascript
key.encrypt(buffer, [encoding], [source_encoding]);
key.encryptPrivate(buffer, [encoding], [source_encoding]); // use private key for encryption
```
Return encrypted data.<br/>

* buffer â `{buffer}` â  data for encrypting, may be string, Buffer, or any object/array. Arrays and objects will encoded to JSON string first.<br/>
* encoding â `{string}` â encoding for output result, may be `'buffer'`, `'binary'`, `'hex'` or `'base64'`. Default `'buffer'`.<br/>
* source_encoding â `{string}` â  source encoding, works only with string buffer. Can take standard Node.js Buffer encodings (hex, utf8, base64, etc). `'utf8'` by default.<br/>

```javascript
key.decrypt(buffer, [encoding]);
key.decryptPublic(buffer, [encoding]); // use public key for decryption
```
Return decrypted data.<br/>

* buffer â `{buffer}` â data for decrypting. Takes Buffer object or base64 encoded string.<br/>
* encoding â `{string}` â encoding for result string. Can also take `'buffer'` for raw Buffer object, or `'json'` for automatic JSON.parse result. Default `'buffer'`.

> *Notice:* `encryptPrivate` and `decryptPublic` using only pkcs1 padding type 1 (not random)

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

- [Example](#example)
- [API](#api)
- [License](#license)

### iOS Version
The usage of the TouchID is based on a framework, named **Local Authentication**.

It provides a **Default View** that prompts the user to place a finger to the iPhoneâs button for scanning.

</div>

### Android Version
4.0.0 Prefers the new native Android BiometricPrompt lib on any Android >= v23 (M)
4.0.0 also DEPRECATES support for the legacy library that provides support for Samsung & MeiZu phones

3.0.2 and below: 
Using an expandable Android Fingerprint API library, which combines [Samsung](http://developer.samsung.com/galaxy/pass#) and [MeiZu](http://open-wiki.flyme.cn/index.php?title=%E6%8C%87%E7%BA%B9%E8%AF%86%E5%88%ABAPI)'s official Fingerprint API.

Samsung and MeiZu's Fingerprint SDK supports most devices which system versions less than Android 6.0.

4. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)

#### Android

1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java`
  - Add `import com.hieuvp.fingerprint.ReactNativeFingerprintScannerPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
  - Add `new ReactNativeFingerprintScannerPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method
2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
  	```
  	include ':react-native-fingerprint-scanner'
  	project(':react-native-fingerprint-scanner').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-fingerprint-scanner/android')
  	```
3. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:
  	```
    implementation project(':react-native-fingerprint-scanner')
  	```

### App Permissions

Add the following permissions to their respective files:

#### Android
In your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

API level 28+ (Uses Android native BiometricPrompt) ([Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#USE_BIOMETRIC))
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC" />
```

API level 23-28 (Uses Android native FingerprintCompat) [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#USE_FINGERPRINT)) 
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT" />
```

// DEPRECATED in 4.0.0
API level <23 (Uses device-specific native fingerprinting, if available - Samsung & MeiZu only) [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#USE_FINGERPRINT)) 
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT" />
```
#### iOS
In your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) requires FaceID access to allows you quick and secure access.</string>
```

### Extra Configuration

1. Make sure the following versions are all correct in `android/app/build.gradle`
    ```
    // API v29 enables FaceId
    android {
        compileSdkVersion 29
        buildToolsVersion "29.0.2"
    ...
        defaultConfig {
          targetSdkVersion 29
    ```

2. Add necessary rules to `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` if you are using proguard:

- `error: FingerprintScannerError { name, message, biometric }` - The name and message of failure and the biometric type in use.

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  FingerprintScanner
    .isSensorAvailable()
    .then(biometryType => this.setState({ biometryType }))
    .catch(error => this.setState({ errorMessage: error.message }));
}
```

### `authenticate({ description, fallbackEnabled })`: (iOS)
Starts Fingerprint authentication on iOS.

- Returns a `Promise`
- `description: String` - the string to explain the request for user authentication.
- `fallbackEnabled: Boolean` - default to `true`, whether to display fallback button (e.g. Enter Password).

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  FingerprintScanner
    .authenticate({ description: 'Scan your fingerprint on the device scanner to continue' })
    .then(() => {
      this.props.handlePopupDismissed();
      AlertIOS.alert('Authenticated successfully');
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      this.props.handlePopupDismissed();
      AlertIOS.alert(error.message);
    });
}
```

### `authenticate({ title="Log In", subTitle, description, cancelButton="Cancel", onAttempt=() => (null) })`: (Android)
Starts Fingerprint authentication on Android.

- Returns a `Promise`
- `title: String` the title text to display in the native Android popup
- `subTitle: String` the sub title text to display in the native Android popup
- `description: String` the description text to display in the native Android popup
- `cancelButton: String` the cancel button text to display in the native Android popup
- `onAttempt: Function` - a callback function when users are trying to scan their fingerprint but failed.

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  if (requiresLegacyAuthentication()) {
    authLegacy();
  } else {
    authCurrent();

### `release()`: (Android)
Stops fingerprint scanner listener, releases cache of internal state in native code, and cancels native prompt if visible.

- Returns a `Void`

```javascript
componentWillUnmount() {
  FingerprintScanner.release();
}
```

### `Types of Biometrics`

| Value | OS | Description|
|---|---|---|
| Touch ID | iOS | |
| Face ID | iOS | |
| Biometrics | Android | Refers to the biometric set as preferred on the device |

### `Errors`

### readline@1.3.0

From https://github.com/maleck13/readline.

**BSD***:


````
## _readline_
> Read a file line by line.

## Install

## Important. In node 10 there is a core module named readline. Please use linebyline instead, it is the same module just renamed:
[Npm linebyline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linebyline)

```sh
npm install linebyline
```

## Test
```sh
npm install .
npm test

```


## What's this?

Simple streaming readline module for NodeJS. Reads a file and buffers new lines emitting a _line_ event for each line.

## Usage
### Simple
```js
  var readline = require('linebyline'),
      rl = readline('./somefile.txt');
  rl.on('line', function(line, lineCount, byteCount) {
    // do something with the line of text
  })
  .on('error', function(e) {
    // something went wrong
  });
```

### ASCII file decoding
As the underlying `fs.createReadStream` doesn't care about the specific ASCII encoding of the file, an alternative way to decode the file is by telling the `readline` library to retain buffer and then decoding it using a converter (e.g. [`iconv-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconv-lite)).
```js
  var readline = require('linebyline'),
      rl = readline('./file-in-win1251.txt', {
    retainBuffer: true //tell readline to retain buffer 
  });
  rl.on("line", function (data,linecount){
    var line = iconv.decode(data, 'win1251');
    // do something with the line of converted text
  });
```
##API
## readLine(readingObject[, options])
### Params:

* `readingObject` - file path or stream object
* `options` can include:
  * `maxLineLength` - override the default 4K buffer size (lines longer than this will not be read)
  * `retainBuffer` - avoid converting to String prior to emitting 'line' event; will pass raw buffer with encoded data to the callback

### Return:

* **EventEmitter**

socks-proxy-agent
================
### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a
specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http`
and `https` modules.

It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket
connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the "Examples" section below.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install socks-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### TypeScript example

```ts
import https from 'https';
import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';

const info = {
	host: 'br41.nordvpn.com',
	userId: 'your-name@gmail.com',
	password: 'abcdef12345124'
};
const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(info);

https.get('https://jsonip.org', { agent }, (res) => {
	console.log(res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `http` module example

```js
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

http.get(opts, function (res) {
	console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `https` module example

```js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

https.get(opts, function (res) {
	console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);

// initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
	console.log('"open" event!');
	socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
	console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
	socket.close();
});
```

stream
======

Node.js streams in the browser.

Ported straight from the [Node.js core](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/stream.js) and adapted to [component/emitter](https://github.com/component/emitter)'s api.

For docs:

* [Stream Node.js v0.8.9 Manual & Documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html)
* [Stream Handbook](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook)

A [testsuite](https://github.com/juliangruber/stream/blob/master/test.html) for the browser is there too. Just issue `npm install` after you've cloned this repo and then open the html file.

Installation
------------

Install with [component(1)](https://github.com/component/component)

```bash
$ component install juliangruber/stream
```
or

```
$ npm install stream
```

Usage example
-------------

```javascript
var Stream = require('stream');

var src = new Stream();
src.readable = true;

var dest = new Stream();
dest.writable = true;
dest.write = function(data) {
  assert(data == 'test');
};

src.pipe(dest);

src.emit('data', 'test');
```

# String-padding

Padding strings in [node](http://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

`$ npm install string-padding`

## Usage

    var pad = require('string-padding');
    pad(string [, length [, padding [, side ]]]);

- **string**: A string of text of any length.
- **length** (optional): The length the output string should be. It doesnât truncate the original string.
- **padding** (optional): The character(s) for padding. You can go crazy with multiple characters ;)
- **side** (optional): The side which should be padded; `pad.LEFT`, `pad.RIGHT` or `pad.BOTH`.

## Extending core String object

For those who are fine with extending the core String object, you can do just that. Note you can skip the first parameter and directly call `.pad()` on a string.

```javascript
var pad = require('string-padding');
String.prototype.pad = pad.prototype;

'Hello World!'.pad(16, '0'); // 0000Hello World!
```

Happy padding! :)

From https://github.com/satya164/use-latest-callback.

**MIT**:


````
# use-latest-callback

React hook which returns the latest callback without changing the reference.

This is useful for scenarios such as event listeners where you may not want to resubscribe when the callback changes.

## Installation

Open a Terminal in the project root and run:

```sh
npm install use-latest-callback
```

## Usage

The `useLatestCallback` hook accepts a function as its argument, and returns a function which preserves its reference across renders.

```js
const useLatestCallback = require('use-latest-callback');

// ...

function MyComponent() {
  const callback = useLatestCallback((value) => {
    console.log('Changed', value);
  });

  React.useEffect(() => {
    someEvent.addListener(callback);

    return someEvent.removeListener(callback);
  }, [callback]);

  return <>{/* whatever */}</>;
}

In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OFL license applies to all icons
packaged as web and desktop font files.

Copyright (c) 2023 Fonticons, Inc. (https://fontawesome.com)
with Reserved Font Name: "Font Awesome".

This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:
http://scripts.sil.org/OFL

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE
Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting â in part or in whole â any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a

Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

1. Definitions

    Adaptation means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
    Collection means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
    Distribute means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
    Licensor means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
    Original Author means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
    Work means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
    You means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
    Publicly Perform means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
    Reproduce means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights.

Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

    to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

    to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";

    to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,

    to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

    For the avoidance of doubt:

        Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

        Waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,

        Voluntary License Schemes . The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f) , all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.

The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b) , as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b) , as requested.

    If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a) , keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b) , in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

    Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
    The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

# react-datetime

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/arqex/react-datetime.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/arqex/react-datetime)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-datetime.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/react-datetime)

A date and time picker in the same React.js component. It can be used as a datepicker, timepicker or both at the same time. It is **highly customizable** and it even allows to edit date's milliseconds.

> **Back to the roots!** Thanks to the people of [YouCanBook.me (best scheduling tool)](https://youcanbook.me) for sponsoring react-datetime for so long. Now the project returns to the community and we are **looking for contributors** to continue improving react-datetime. [Would you like to give a hand?](contribute-home.md)

**Version 3 is out!** These are the docs for version 3 of the library. If you are still using the deprecated v2, [here it is its documentation](https://github.com/arqex/react-datetime/blob/2a83208452ac5e41c43fea31ef47c65efba0bb56/README.md), but we strongly recommend to migrate to version 3 in order to keep receiving updates. Please check [migrating react-datetime to version 3](migrateToV3.md) to safely update your app.

## Installation

Install using npm:
```sh
npm install --save react-datetime
```

Install using yarn:
```sh
yarn add react-datetime
```

## Usage

[React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) are peer dependencies for react-datetime (as well as [Moment.js timezones](https://momentjs.com/timezone/) if you want to use the `displayTimeZone` prop). These dependencies are not installed along with react-datetime automatically, but your project needs to have them installed in order to make the datepicker work. You can then use the datepicker like in the example below.

```js
// Import the library
import Datetime from 'react-datetime';

// return it from your components
return <Datetime />;
```
[See this example working](https://codesandbox.io/s/boring-dew-uzln3).

Do you want more examples? [Have a look at our resources gallery](resources.md).

**Don't forget to add the [CSS stylesheet](https://github.com/arqex/react-datetime/blob/master/css/react-datetime.css) to make it work out of the box.**. You only need to do this once in your app:

```js
import "react-datetime/css/react-datetime.css";
```

## API

Below we have all the props that we can use with the `<DateTime>` component. There are also some methods that can be used imperatively.

| Name         | Type    | Default | Description |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **value** | `Date` | `new Date()` | Represents the selected date by the component, in order to use it as a [controlled component](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components). This prop is parsed by Moment.js, so it is possible to use a date `string` or a `moment` object. |
| **initialValue** | `Date` | `new Date()` | Represents the selected date for the component to use it as a [uncontrolled component](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/uncontrolled-components.html). This prop is parsed by Moment.js, so it is possible to use a date `string` or a `moment` object. If you need to set the selected date programmatically after the picker is initialized, please use the `value` prop instead. |
| **initialViewDate** | `Date` | `new Date()` | Define the month/year/decade/time which is viewed on opening the calendar. This prop is parsed by Moment.js, so it is possible to use a date `string` or a `moment` object. If you want to set the view date after the component has been initialize [see the imperative API](#imperative-api). |
| **initialViewMode** | `string` or `number` | `'days'` | The default view to display when the picker is shown for the first time (`'years'`, `'months'`, `'days'`, `'time'`). If you want to set the view mode after the component has been initialize [see the imperative API](#imperative-api). |
| **updateOnView** | `string` | Intelligent guess | By default we can navigate through years and months without actualling updating the selected date. Only when we get to one view called the "updating view", we make a selection there and the value gets updated, triggering an `onChange` event. By default the updating view will get guessed by using the `dateFormat` so if our dates only show months and never days, the update is done in the `months` view. If we set `updateOnView="time"` selecting a day will navigate to the time view. The time view always updates the selected date, never navigates. If `closeOnSelect={ true }`, making a selection in the view defined by `updateOnView` will close the calendar. |
| **dateFormat**   | `boolean` or `string`  | `true` | Defines the format for the date. It accepts any [Moment.js date format](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) (not in localized format). If `true` the date will be displayed using the defaults for the current locale. If `false` the datepicker is disabled and the component can be used as timepicker, see [available units docs](#specify-available-units). |
| **timeFormat**   | `boolean` or `string`  | `true` | Defines the format for the time. It accepts any [Moment.js time format](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) (not in localized format). If `true` the time will be displayed using the defaults for the current locale. If `false` the timepicker is disabled and the component can be used as datepicker, see [available units docs](#specify-available-units). |
| **input** | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to show an input field to edit the date manually. |
| **open** | `boolean` | `null` | Whether to open or close the picker. If not set react-datetime will open the datepicker on input focus and close it on click outside. |
| **locale** | `string` | `null` | Manually set the locale for the react-datetime instance. Moment.js locale needs to be loaded to be used, see [i18n docs](#i18n).
| **utc** | `boolean` | `false` | When true, input time values will be interpreted as UTC (Zulu time) by Moment.js. Otherwise they will default to the user's local timezone.
| **displayTimeZone** | `string` | `null` | **Needs [moment's timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/) available in your project.** When specified, input time values will be displayed in the given time zone. Otherwise they will default to the user's local timezone (unless `utc` specified).
| **onChange** | `function` | empty function | Callback trigger when the date changes. The callback receives the selected `moment` object as only parameter, if the date in the input is valid. If the date in the input is not valid, the callback receives the value of the input (a string). |
| **onOpen** | `function` | empty function | Callback trigger for when the user opens the datepicker. |
| **onClose** | `function` | empty function | Callback trigger for when the calendar get closed. The callback receives the selected `moment` object as only parameter, if the date in the input is valid. If the date in the input is not valid, the callback returns the value in the input. |
| **onNavigate** | `function` | empty function | Callback trigger when the view mode changes. The callback receives the selected view mode string (`years`, `months`, `days` or `time`) as only parameter.|
| **onBeforeNavigate** | `function` | ( nextView, currentView, viewDate ) => nextView | Allows to intercept a change of the calendar view. The accepted function receives the view that it's supposed to navigate to, the view that is showing currently and the date currently shown in the view. Return a viewMode ( default ones are `years`, `months`, `days` or `time`) to navigate to it. If the function returns a "falsy" value, the navigation is stopped and we will remain in the current view. |
| **onNavigateBack** | `function` | empty function | Callback trigger when the user navigates to the previous month, year or decade. The callback receives the amount and type ('month', 'year') as parameters. |
| **onNavigateForward** | `function` | empty function | Callback trigger when the user navigates to the next month, year or decade. The callback receives the amount and type ('month', 'year') as parameters. |
| **className** | `string` or `string array` | `''` | Extra class name for the outermost markup element. |
| **inputProps** | `object` | `undefined` | Defines additional attributes for the input element of the component. For example: `onClick`, `placeholder`, `disabled`, `required`, `name` and `className` (`className` *sets* the class attribute for the input element). See [Customize the Input Appearance](#customize-the-input-appearance). |
| **isValidDate** | `function` | `() => true` | Define the dates that can be selected. The function receives `(currentDate, selectedDate)` and shall return a `true` or `false` whether the `currentDate` is valid or not. See [selectable dates](#selectable-dates).|
| **renderInput** | `function` | `undefined` | Replace the rendering of the input element. The function has the following arguments: the default calculated `props` for the input, `openCalendar` (a function which opens the calendar) and `closeCalendar` (a function which closes the calendar). Must return a React component or `null`. See [Customize the Input Appearance](#customize-the-input-appearance). |
| **renderView** | `function` | `(viewMode, renderDefault) => renderDefault()` | Customize the way the calendar is rendered. The accepted function receives the type of the view it's going to be rendered `'years', 'months', 'days', 'time'` and a function to render the default view of react-datetime, this way it's possible to wrap the original view adding our own markup or override it completely with our own code. See [Customize the Datepicker Appearance](#customize-the-datepicker-appearance). |
| **renderDay** | `function` | `DOM.td(day)` | Customize the way that the days are shown in the daypicker. The accepted function has the `selectedDate`, the current date and the default calculated `props` for the cell, and must return a React component. See [Customize the Datepicker Appearance](#customize-the-datepicker-appearance). |
| **renderMonth** | `function` | `DOM.td(month)` | Customize the way that the months are shown in the monthpicker. The accepted function has the `selectedDate`, the current date and the default calculated `props` for the cell, the `month` and the `year` to be shown, and must return a React component. See [Customize the Datepicker Appearance](#customize-the-datepicker-appearance). |
| **renderYear** | `function` | `DOM.td(year)` | Customize the way that the years are shown in the year picker. The accepted function has the `selectedDate`, the current date and the default calculated `props` for the cell, the `year` to be shown, and must return a React component. See [Customize the Datepicker Appearance](#customize-the-datepicker-appearance). |
| **strictParsing** | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to use Moment.js's [strict parsing](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/) when parsing input.
| **closeOnSelect** | `boolean` | `false` | When `true`, once the day has been selected, the datepicker will be automatically closed.
| **closeOnTab** | `boolean` | `true` | When `true` and the input is focused, pressing the `tab` key will close the datepicker.
| **timeConstraints** | `object` | `null` | Add some constraints to the timepicker. It accepts an `object` with the format `{ hours: { min: 9, max: 15, step: 2 }}`, this example means the hours can't be lower than `9` and higher than `15`, and it will change adding or subtracting `2` hours everytime the buttons are clicked. The constraints can be added to the `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds` and `milliseconds`.
| **closeOnClickOutside** | `boolean` | `true` | When the calendar is open and `closeOnClickOutside` is `true` (its default value), clickin outside of the calendar or input closes the calendar. If `false` the calendar stays open.

## Imperative API
Besides controlling the selected date, there is a navigation through months, years, decades that react-datetime handles for us. We can interfere in it, stopping view transtions by using the prop `onBeforeNavigate`, but we can also navigate to a specific view and date by using some imperative methods.

To do so, we need to create our component with a `ref` prop amd use the reference.
```js
// This would be the code to render the picker
<DateTime ref="datetime" />

// ... once rendered we can use the imperative API
// let's show the years view
this.refs.datetime.navigate('years')
```

Available methods are:
* **navigate( viewMode )**: Set the view currently shown by the calendar. View modes shipped with react-datetime are `years`, `months`, `days` and `time`, but you can alse navigate to custom modes that can be defined by using the `renderView` prop.
* **setViewDate( date )**: Set the date that is currently shown in the calendar. This is independent from the selected date and it's the one used to navigate through months or days in the calendar. It accepts a string in the format of the current locale, a `Date` or a `Moment` object as parameter.

## i18n
Different language and date formats are supported by react-datetime. React uses [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) to format the dates, and the easiest way of changing the language of the calendar is [changing the Moment.js locale](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/changing-locale/).

Don't forget to import your locale file from the moment's `moment/locale` folder.

```js
import moment from 'moment';
import 'moment/locale/fr';
// Now react-datetime will be in french
```

If there are multiple locales loaded, you can use the prop `locale` to define what language shall be used by the instance.
```js
<Datetime locale="fr-ca" />
<Datetime locale="de" />
```
[Here you can see the i18n example working](https://codesandbox.io/s/interesting-kare-0707b).

## Customize the Input Appearance
It is possible to customize the way that the input is displayed. The simplest is to supply `inputProps` which will get directly assigned to the `<input />` element within the component. We can tweak the inputs this way:

```js
let inputProps = {
    placeholder: 'N/A',
    disabled: true,
    onMouseLeave: () => alert('You went to the input but it was disabled')
};

<Datetime inputProps={ inputProps } />
```
[See the customized input working](https://codesandbox.io/s/clever-wildflower-81r26?file=/src/App.js)


Alternatively, if you need to render different content than an `<input />` element, you may supply a `renderInput` function which is called instead.

```js
class MyDTPicker extends React.Component {
    render(){
        return <Datetime renderInput={ this.renderInput } />;
    }
    renderInput( props, openCalendar, closeCalendar ){
        function clear(){
            props.onChange({target: {value: ''}});
        }
        return (
            <div>
                <input {...props} />
                <button onClick={openCalendar}>open calendar</button>
                <button onClick={closeCalendar}>close calendar</button>
                <button onClick={clear}>clear</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

[See this example working](https://codesandbox.io/s/peaceful-water-3gb5m)


Or maybe you just want to shown the calendar and don't need an input at all. In that case `input={ false }` will make the trick:

```js
    <Datetime input={ false } />;
```
[See react-datetime calendar working without an input](https://codesandbox.io/s/busy-vaughan-wh773)

## Customize the Datepicker Appearance
It is possible to customize the way that the datepicker display the days, months and years in the calendar. To adapt the calendar for every need it is possible to use the props `renderDay(props, currentDate, selectedDate)`, `renderMonth(props, month, year, selectedDate)` and `renderYear(props, year, selectedDate)` to customize the output of each rendering method.

```js
class MyDTPicker extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Datetime
        renderDay={this.renderDay}
        renderMonth={this.renderMonth}
        renderYear={this.renderYear}
      />
    );
  }
  renderDay(props, currentDate, selectedDate) {
    // Adds 0 to the days in the days view
    return <td {...props}>{"0" + currentDate.date()}</td>;
  }
  renderMonth(props, month, year, selectedDate) {
    // Display the month index in the months view
    return <td {...props}>{month}</td>;
  }
  renderYear(props, year, selectedDate) {
    // Just display the last 2 digits of the year in the years view
    return <td {...props}>{year % 100}</td>;
  }
}
```
[See the customized calendar here.](https://codesandbox.io/s/peaceful-kirch-69e06)

It's also possible to override some view in the calendar completelly. Let's say that we want to add a today button in our calendars, when we click it we go to the today view:
```js
class MyDTPicker extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Datetime
        ref="datetime"
        renderView={(mode, renderDefault) =>
          this.renderView(mode, renderDefault)
        }
      />
    );
  }

  renderView(mode, renderDefault) {
    // Only for years, months and days view
    if (mode === "time") return renderDefault();

    return (
      <div className="wrapper">
        {renderDefault()}
        <div className="controls">
          <button onClick={() => this.goToToday()}>Today</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }

  goToToday() {
    // Reset
    this.refs.datetime.setViewDate(new Date());
    this.refs.datetime.navigate("days");
  }
}
```
[See it working](https://codesandbox.io/s/frosty-fog-nrwk2)

#### Method Parameters
* `props` is the object that the datepicker has calculated for this object. It is convenient to use this object as the `props` for your custom component, since it knows how to handle the click event and its `className` attribute is used by the default styles.
* `selectedDate` and `currentDate` are [moment objects](http://momentjs.com) and can be used to change the output depending on the selected date, or the date for the current day.
* `month` and `year` are the numeric representation of the current month and year to be displayed. Notice that the possible `month` values range from `0` to `11`.

## Make it work as a year picker or a time picker
You can filter out what you want the user to be able to pick by using `dateFormat` and `timeFormat`, e.g. to create a timepicker, yearpicker etc.

In this example the component is being used as a *timepicker* and can *only be used for selecting a time*.
```js
<Datetime dateFormat={false} />
```
[Working example of a timepicker here.](https://codesandbox.io/s/loving-nobel-sbok2)

In this example you can *only select a year and month*.
```js
<Datetime dateFormat="YYYY-MM" timeFormat={false} />
```
[Working example of only selecting year and month here.](https://codesandbox.io/s/recursing-pascal-xl643)

## Blocking some dates to be selected
It is possible to disable dates in the calendar if the user are not allowed to select them, e.g. dates in the past. This is done using the prop `isValidDate`, which admits a function in the form `function(currentDate, selectedDate)` where both arguments are [moment objects](http://momentjs.com). The function shall return `true` for selectable dates, and `false` for disabled ones.

In the example below are *all dates before today* disabled.

```js
import moment from 'moment';
var yesterday = moment().subtract( 1, 'day' );
var valid = function( current ){
    return current.isAfter( yesterday );
};
<Datetime isValidDate={ valid } />
```
[Working example of disabled days here.](https://codesandbox.io/s/thirsty-shape-l4qg4)

It's also possible to disable *the weekends*, as shown in the example below.
```js
var valid = function( current ){
    return current.day() !== 0 && current.day() !== 6;
};
<Datetime isValidDate={ valid } />
```

# React-Select

The Select control for [React](https://reactjs.com). Initially built for use in [KeystoneJS](http://www.keystonejs.com).

See [react-select.com](https://www.react-select.com) for live demos and comprehensive docs.

React Select is funded by [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au) and [Atlassian](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com). It represents a whole new approach to developing powerful React.js components that _just work_ out of the box, while being extremely customisable.

For the story behind this component, watch Jed's talk at React Conf 2019 - [building React Select](https://youtu.be/yS0jUnmBujE)

Features include:

- Flexible approach to data, with customisable functions
- Extensible styling API with [emotion](https://emotion.sh)
- Component Injection API for complete control over the UI behaviour
- Controllable state props and modular architecture
- Long-requested features like option groups, portal support, animation, and more

## Using an older version?

- [v3, v4, and v5 upgrade guide](https://react-select.com/upgrade)
- [v2 upgrade guide](https://react-select.com/upgrade-to-v2)
- React Select v1 documentation and examples are available at [v1.react-select.com](https://v1.react-select.com)

# Installation and usage

The easiest way to use react-select is to install it from npm and build it into your app with Webpack.

```
yarn add react-select
```

Then use it in your app:

#### With React Component

```js
import React from 'react';
import Select from 'react-select';

const options = [
  { value: 'chocolate', label: 'Chocolate' },
  { value: 'strawberry', label: 'Strawberry' },
  { value: 'vanilla', label: 'Vanilla' },
];

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    selectedOption: null,
  };
  handleChange = (selectedOption) => {
    this.setState({ selectedOption }, () =>
      console.log(`Option selected:`, this.state.selectedOption)
    );
  };
  render() {
    const { selectedOption } = this.state;

    return (
      <Select
        value={selectedOption}
        onChange={this.handleChange}
        options={options}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

#### With React Hooks

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Select from 'react-select';

const options = [
  { value: 'chocolate', label: 'Chocolate' },
  { value: 'strawberry', label: 'Strawberry' },
  { value: 'vanilla', label: 'Vanilla' },
];

export default function App() {
  const [selectedOption, setSelectedOption] = useState(null);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Select
        defaultValue={selectedOption}
        onChange={setSelectedOption}
        options={options}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Props

Common props you may want to specify include:

- `autoFocus` - focus the control when it mounts
- `className` - apply a className to the control
- `classNamePrefix` - apply classNames to inner elements with the given prefix
- `isDisabled` - disable the control
- `isMulti` - allow the user to select multiple values
- `isSearchable` - allow the user to search for matching options
- `name` - generate an HTML input with this name, containing the current value
- `onChange` - subscribe to change events
- `options` - specify the options the user can select from
- `placeholder` - change the text displayed when no option is selected
- `noOptionsMessage` - ({ inputValue: string }) => string | null - Text to display when there are no options
- `value` - control the current value

See the [props documentation](https://www.react-select.com/props) for complete documentation on the props react-select supports.

## Controllable Props

You can control the following props by providing values for them. If you don't, react-select will manage them for you.

- `value` / `onChange` - specify the current value of the control
- `menuIsOpen` / `onMenuOpen` / `onMenuClose` - control whether the menu is open
- `inputValue` / `onInputChange` - control the value of the search input (changing this will update the available options)

If you don't provide these props, you can set the initial value of the state they control:

- `defaultValue` - set the initial value of the control
- `defaultMenuIsOpen` - set the initial open value of the menu
- `defaultInputValue` - set the initial value of the search input

## Methods

React-select exposes two public methods:

- `focus()` - focus the control programmatically
- `blur()` - blur the control programmatically

## Customisation

Check the docs for more information on:

- [Customising the styles](https://www.react-select.com/styles)
- [Using custom components](https://www.react-select.com/components)
- [Using the built-in animated components](https://www.react-select.com/home#animated-components)
- [Creating an async select](https://www.react-select.com/async)
- [Allowing users to create new options](https://www.react-select.com/creatable)
- [Advanced use-cases](https://www.react-select.com/advanced)
- [TypeScript guide](https://www.react-select.com/typescript)

## TypeScript

The v5 release represents a rewrite from JavaScript to TypeScript. The types for v4 and earlier releases are available at [@types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-select). See the [TypeScript guide](https://www.react-select.com/typescript) for how to use the types starting with v5.

      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

# amp-message

  High level [AMP](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-amp) `Message` implementation for manipulating, encoding and decoding AMP messages.

## Installation

```
$ npm install amp-message
```

## Example

  Encoding a message:

```js
var Message = require('amp-message');

var msg = new Message;

console.log(msg.toBuffer());
// => <Buffer 10>

msg.push('foo');
msg.push('bar');
msg.push('baz');
console.log(msg.toBuffer());
// => <Buffer 13 00 05 73 3a 66 6f 6f 00 05 73 3a 62 61 72 00 05 73 3a 62 61 7a>

msg.push({ foo: 'bar' });
console.log(msg.toBuffer());
// => <Buffer 14 00 05 73 3a 66 6f 6f 00 05 73 3a 62 61 72 00 05 73 3a 62 61 7a 00 0f 6a 3a 7b 22 66 6f 6f 22 3a 22 62 61 72 22 7d>

msg.push(new Buffer('image data'));
console.log(msg.toBuffer());
// => <Buffer 15 00 05 73 3a 66 6f 6f 00 05 73 3a 62 61 72 00 05 73 3a 62 61 7a 00 0f 6a 3a 7b 22 66 6f 6f 22 3a 22 62 61 72 22 7d 00 0a 69 6d 61 67 65 20 64 61 74 ... >
```

  Decoding a message:

```js
var Message = require('..');

var msg = new Message;

msg.push('foo')
msg.push({ hello: 'world' })
msg.push(new Buffer('hello'))

var other = new Message(msg.toBuffer());

console.log(other.shift());
console.log(other.shift());
console.log(other.shift());
```

## API

### Message

  Initialize an empty message.

### Message(buffer)

  Decode the `buffer` AMP message to populate the `Message`.

### Message(args)

  Initialize a messeage populated with `args`.

### amp@0.3.1

From https://github.com/visionmedia/node-amp.

**MIT**:


````

# amp

  Abstract Message Protocol codec and streaming parser for nodejs.

## Installation

```
$ npm install amp
```

## Example

```js
var bin = amp.encode([new Buffer('hello'), new Buffer('world')]);
var msg = amp.decode(bin);
console.log(msg);
```

## Protocol

  AMP is a simple versioned protocol for framed messages containing
  zero or more "arguments". Each argument is opaque binary, thus you
  may use JSON, BSON, msgpack and others on top of AMP. Multiple argument
  support is used to allow a hybrid of binary/non-binary message args without
  requiring higher level serialization libraries like msgpack or BSON.

  All multi-byte integers are big endian. The `version` and `argc` integers
  are stored in the first byte, followed by a sequence of zero or more
  `<length>` / `<data>` pairs, where `length` is a 32-bit unsigned integer.

```
      0        1 2 3 4     <length>    ...
+------------+----------+------------+
| <ver/argc> | <length> | <data>     | additional arguments
+------------+----------+------------+
```

charm
=====

Use
[ansi terminal characters](http://www.termsys.demon.co.uk/vtansi.htm)
to write colors and cursor positions.

![me lucky charms](http://substack.net/images/charms.png)

example
=======

lucky
-----

````javascript
var charm = require('charm')();
charm.pipe(process.stdout);
charm.reset();

var colors = [ 'red', 'cyan', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue' ];
var text = 'Always after me lucky charms.';

var offset = 0;
var iv = setInterval(function () {
    var y = 0, dy = 1;
    for (var i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
        var color = colors[(i + offset) % colors.length];
        var c = text[(i + offset) % text.length];
        charm
            .move(1, dy)
            .foreground(color)
            .write(c)
        ;
        y += dy;
        if (y <= 0 || y >= 5) dy *= -1;
    }
    charm.position(0, 1);
    offset ++;
}, 150);
````

events
======

Charm objects pass along the data events from their input stream except for
events generated from querying the terminal device.

Because charm puts stdin into raw mode, charm emits two special events: "^C" and
"^D" when the user types those combos. It's super convenient with these events
to do:

````javascript
charm.on('^C', process.exit)
````

The above is set on all `charm` streams. If you want to add your own handling for these
special events simply:

````javascript
charm.removeAllListeners('^C')
charm.on('^C', function () {
  // Don't exit. Do some mad science instead.
})
````

methods
=======

var charm = require('charm')(param or stream, ...)
--------------------------------------------------

Create a new readable/writable `charm` stream.

You can pass in readable or writable streams as parameters and they will be
piped to or from accordingly. You can also pass `process` in which case
`process.stdin` and `process.stdout` will be used.

You can `pipe()` to and from the `charm` object you get back.

charm.reset()
-------------

Reset the entire screen, like the /usr/bin/reset command.

charm.destroy(), charm.end()
----------------------------

Emit an `"end"` event downstream.

charm.write(msg)
----------------

Pass along `msg` to the output stream.

charm.position(x, y)
--------------------

Set the cursor position to the absolute coordinates `x, y`.

charm.position(cb)
------------------

Query the absolute cursor position from the input stream through the output
stream (the shell does this automatically) and get the response back as
`cb(x, y)`.

charm.move(x, y)
----------------

Move the cursor position by the relative coordinates `x, y`.

charm.up(y)
-----------

Move the cursor up by `y` rows.

charm.down(y)
-------------

Move the cursor down by `y` rows.

charm.left(x)
-------------

Move the cursor left by `x` columns.

charm.right(x)
--------------

Move the cursor right by `x` columns.

charm.push(withAttributes=false)
--------------------------------

Push the cursor state and optionally the attribute state.

charm.pop(withAttributes=false)
-------------------------------

Pop the cursor state and optionally the attribute state.

charm.erase(s)
--------------

Erase a region defined by the string `s`.

`s` can be:

* end - erase from the cursor to the end of the line
* start - erase from the cursor to the start of the line
* line - erase the current line
* down - erase everything below the current line
* up - erase everything above the current line
* screen - erase the entire screen

charm.display(attr)
-------------------

Set the display mode with the string `attr`.

`attr` can be:

* reset
* bright
* dim
* underscore
* blink
* reverse
* hidden

charm.foreground(color)
-----------------------

Set the foreground color with the string `color`, which can be:

* red
* yellow
* green
* blue
* cyan
* magenta
* black
* white

or `color` can be an integer from 0 to 255, inclusive.

charm.background(color)
-----------------------

Set the background color with the string `color`, which can be:

* red
* yellow
* green
* blue
* cyan
* magenta
* black
* white

or `color` can be an integer from 0 to 255, inclusive.

charm.cursor(visible)
---------------------

Set the cursor visibility with a boolean `visible`.

install
=======

With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install charm
```

**BSD-2-Clause**:


````
## Add dynamic instrumentation to emitters

`shimmer` does a bunch of the work necessary to wrap other methods in
a wrapper you provide:

```javascript
var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
var wrapEmitter = require('emitter-listener');

var ee = new EventEmitter();

var id = 0;

wrapEmitter(
  ee,
  function mark(listener) {
    listener.id = id++;
  },
  function prepare(listener) {
    console.log('listener id is %d', listener.id);
  }
);
```

### Mandatory disclaimer

There are times when it's necessary to monkeypatch default behavior in
JavaScript and Node. However, changing the behavior of the runtime on the fly
is rarely a good idea, and you should be using this module because you need to,
not because it seems like fun.

#### wrapEmitter(emitter, mark, prepare)

Wrap an EventEmitter's event listeners. Each listener will be passed to
`mark` when it is registered with `.addListener()` or `.on()`, and then
each listener is passed to `prepare` to be wrapped before it's called
by the `.emit()` call. `wrapListener` deals with the single listener
vs array of listeners logic, and also ensures that edge cases like
`.removeListener()` being called from within an `.emit()` for the same
event type is handled properly.

The wrapped EE can be restored to its pristine state by using
emitter.__unwrap(), but this should only be used if you *really* know
what you're doing.

Lazy lists for node
===================


# Table of contents:

[Introduction](#Introduction)
  
[Documentation](#Documentation)

<a name="Introduction" />
# Introduction
Lazy comes really handy when you need to treat a stream of events like a list.
The best use case currently is returning a lazy list from an asynchronous
function, and having data pumped into it via events. In asynchronous
programming you can't just return a regular list because you don't yet have
data for it. The usual solution so far has been to provide a callback that gets
called when the data is available. But doing it this way you lose the power of
chaining functions and creating pipes, which leads to not that nice interfaces.
(See the 2nd example below to see how it improved the interface in one of my
modules.)

Check out this toy example, first you create a Lazy object:
```javascript
    var Lazy = require('lazy');

    var lazy = new Lazy;
    lazy
      .filter(function (item) {
        return item % 2 == 0
      })
      .take(5)
      .map(function (item) {
        return item*2;
      })
      .join(function (xs) {
        console.log(xs);
      });
```

This code says that 'lazy' is going to be a lazy list that filters even
numbers, takes first five of them, then multiplies all of them by 2, and then
calls the join function (think of join as in threads) on the final list.

And now you can emit 'data' events with data in them at some point later,
```javascript
    [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].forEach(function (x) {
      lazy.emit('data', x);
    });
```

The output will be produced by the 'join' function, which will output the
expected [0, 4, 8, 12, 16].

And here is a real-world example. Some time ago I wrote a hash database for
node.js called node-supermarket (think of key-value store except greater). Now
it had a similar interface as a list, you could .forEach on the stored
elements, .filter them, etc. But being asynchronous in nature it lead to the
following code, littered with callbacks and temporary lists:
```javascript
    var Store = require('supermarket');

    var db = new Store({ filename : 'users.db', json : true });

    var users_over_20 = [];
    db.filter(
      function (user, meta) {
        // predicate function
        return meta.age > 20;
      },
      function (err, user, meta) {
        // function that gets executed when predicate is true
        if (users_over_20.length < 5)
          users_over_20.push(meta);
      },
      function () {
        // done function, called when all records have been filtered

        // now do something with users_over_20
      }
    )
```
This code selects first five users who are over 20 years old and stores them
in users_over_20.

But now we changed the node-supermarket interface to return lazy lists, and
the code became:
```javascript
    var Store = require('supermarket');

    var db = new Store({ filename : 'users.db', json : true });

    db.filter(function (user, meta) {
        return meta.age > 20;
      })
      .take(5)
      .join(function (xs) {
        // xs contains the first 5 users who are over 20!
      });
```
This is so much nicer!

Here is the latest feature: .lines. Given a stream of data that has \n's in it,
.lines converts that into a list of lines.

Here is an example from node-iptables that I wrote the other week,
```javascript
    var Lazy = require('lazy');
    var spawn = require('child_process').spawn;
    var iptables = spawn('iptables', ['-L', '-n', '-v']);

    Lazy(iptables.stdout)
        .lines
        .map(String)
        .skip(2) // skips the two lines that are iptables header
        .map(function (line) {
            // packets, bytes, target, pro, opt, in, out, src, dst, opts
            var fields = line.trim().split(/\s+/, 9);
            return {
                parsed : {
                    packets : fields[0],
                    bytes : fields[1],
                    target : fields[2],
                    protocol : fields[3],
                    opt : fields[4],
                    in : fields[5],
                    out : fields[6],
                    src : fields[7],
                    dst : fields[8]
                },
                raw : line.trim()
            };
        });
```
This example takes the `iptables -L -n -v` command and uses .lines on its output.
Then it .skip's two lines from input and maps a function on all other lines that
creates a data structure from the output.

# Documentation

Supports the following operations:

* lazy.filter(f)
* lazy.forEach(f)
* lazy.map(f)
* lazy.take(n)
* lazy.takeWhile(f)
* lazy.bucket(init, f)
* lazy.lines
* lazy.sum(f)
* lazy.product(f)
* lazy.foldr(op, i, f)
* lazy.skip(n)
* lazy.head(f)
* lazy.tail(f)
* lazy.join(f)

The Lazy object itself has a .range property for generating all the possible ranges.

Here are several examples:

* Lazy.range('10..') - infinite range starting from 10
* Lazy.range('(10..') - infinite range starting from 11
* Lazy.range(10) - range from 0 to 9
* Lazy.range(-10, 10) - range from -10 to 9 (-10, -9, ... 0, 1, ... 9)
* Lazy.range(-10, 10, 2) - range from -10 to 8, skipping every 2nd element (-10, -8, ... 0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
* Lazy.range(10, 0, 2) - reverse range from 10 to 1, skipping every 2nd element (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)
* Lazy.range(10, 0) - reverse range from 10 to 1
* Lazy.range('5..50') - range from 5 to 49
* Lazy.range('50..44') - range from 50 to 45
* Lazy.range('1,1.1..4') - range from 1 to 4 with increment of 0.1 (1, 1.1, 1.2, ... 3.9)
* Lazy.range('4,3.9..1') - reverse range from 4 to 1 with decerement of 0.1
* Lazy.range('[1..10]') - range from 1 to 10 (all inclusive)
* Lazy.range('[10..1]') - range from 10 to 1 (all inclusive)
* Lazy.range('[1..10)') - range grom 1 to 9
* Lazy.range('[10..1)') - range from 10 to 2
* Lazy.range('(1..10]') - range from 2 to 10
* Lazy.range('(10..1]') - range from 9 to 1
* Lazy.range('(1..10)') - range from 2 to 9
* Lazy.range('[5,10..50]') - range from 5 to 50 with a step of 5 (all inclusive)

Then you can use other lazy functions on these ranges.

# pg-types

This is the code that turns all the raw text from postgres into JavaScript types for [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres.git)

## use

This module is consumed and exported from the root `pg` object of node-postgres.  To access it, do the following:

```js
var types = require('pg').types
```

Generally what you'll want to do is override how a specific data-type is parsed and turned into a JavaScript type.  By default the PostgreSQL backend server returns everything as strings.  Every data type corresponds to a unique `OID` within the server, and these `OIDs` are sent back with the query response.  So, you need to match a particluar `OID` to a function you'd like to use to take the raw text input and produce a valid JavaScript object as a result. `null` values are never parsed.

Let's do something I commonly like to do on projects: return 64-bit integers `(int8)` as JavaScript integers.  Because JavaScript doesn't have support for 64-bit integers node-postgres cannot confidently parse `int8` data type results as numbers because if you have a _huge_ number it will overflow and the result you'd get back from node-postgres would not be the result in the datbase.  That would be a __very bad thing__ so node-postgres just returns `int8` results as strings and leaves the parsing up to you.  Let's say that you know you don't and wont ever have numbers greater than `int4` in your database, but you're tired of recieving results from the `COUNT(*)` function as strings (because that function returns `int8`).  You would do this:

```js
var types = require('pg').types
types.setTypeParser(20, function(val) {
  return parseInt(val)
})
```

__boom__: now you get numbers instead of strings.

Just as another example -- not saying this is a good idea -- let's say you want to return all dates from your database as [moment](http://momentjs.com/docs/) objects.  Okay, do this:

```js
var types = require('pg').types
var moment = require('moment')
var parseFn = function(val) {
   return val === null ? null : moment(val)
}
types.setTypeParser(types.builtins.TIMESTAMPTZ, parseFn)
types.setTypeParser(types.builtins.TIMESTAMP, parseFn)
```
_note: I've never done that with my dates, and I'm not 100% sure moment can parse all the date strings returned from postgres.  It's just an example!_

If you're thinking "gee, this seems pretty handy, but how can I get a list of all the OIDs in the database and what they correspond to?!?!?!" worry not:

```bash
$ psql -c "select typname, oid, typarray from pg_type order by oid"
```

If you want to find out the OID of a specific type:

```bash
$ psql -c "select typname, oid, typarray from pg_type where typname = 'daterange' order by oid"
```

### pgpass@1.0.4

From https://github.com/hoegaarden/pgpass.

# pgpass

[![Build Status](https://github.com/hoegaarden/pgpass/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/hoegaarden/pgpass/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amaster)

## Install

```sh
npm install pgpass
```

## Usage
```js
var pgPass = require('pgpass');

var connInfo = {
  'host' : 'pgserver' ,
  'user' : 'the_user_name' ,
};

pgPass(connInfo, function(pass){
  conn_info.password = pass;
  // connect to postgresql server
});
```

## Description

This module tries to read the `~/.pgpass` file (or the equivalent for windows systems). If the environment variable `PGPASSFILE` is set, this file is used instead. If everything goes right, the password from said file is passed to the callback; if the password cannot be read `undefined` is passed to the callback.

Cases where `undefined` is returned:

- the environment variable `PGPASSWORD` is set
- the file cannot be read (wrong permissions, no such file, ...)
- for non windows systems: the file is write-/readable by the group or by other users
- there is no matching line for the given connection info

There should be no need to use this module directly; it is already included in `node-postgres`.

## Configuration

The module reads the environment variable `PGPASS_NO_DEESCAPE` to decide if the the read tokens from the password file should be de-escaped or not. Default is to do de-escaping. For further information on this see [this commit](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/8d15e3ec4fcb735875a8a70a09ec0c62153c3329).


## Tests

There are tests in `./test/`; including linting and coverage testing. Running `npm test` runs:

- `jshint`
- `mocha` tests
- `jscoverage` and `mocha -R html-cov`

You can see the coverage report in `coverage.html`.


## Development, Patches, Bugs, ...

If you find Bugs or have improvements, please feel free to open a issue on GitHub. If you provide a pull request, I'm more than happy to merge them, just make sure to add tests for your changes.

multimeter
==========

Control multiple ANSI progress bars on the terminal.

![multibar example output](http://substack.net/images/screenshots/multibar.png)

![multimeter](http://substack.net/images/multimeter.png)

example
=======

````javascript
var multimeter = require('multimeter');
var multi = multimeter(process);

multi.drop(function (bar) {
    var iv = setInterval(function () {
        var p = bar.percent();

        if (p >= 100) clearInterval(iv);
    }, 25);
});
````

methods
=======

var multimeter = require('multimeter');

var multi = multimeter(stream, ...)
-----------------------------------

Create a new multimeter handle on the supplied stream/process objects, which
will be passed directly to [charm](https://github.com/substack/node-charm).

If you pass in a charm object that will be used instead of creating a new one.

var bar = multi(x, y, params)
-----------------------------

Create a new progress bar at `(x,y)` with `params` which default to:

* width : 10
* before : '['
* after : '] '
* solid : { background : 'blue', foreground : 'white', text : '|' }
* empty : { background : null, foreground : null, text : ' ' }

If `y` is negative or `'-0'` it will be treated as a relative coordinate.

var bar = multi.rel(x, y, params)
---------------------------------

Create a new progress bar at an absolute `x` and relative `y` coordinate with
respect to the present `multi.offset`.

multi.drop(params, cb)
----------------------

Create a new progress bar at the present cursor location. The `bar` object will
be passed to `cb(bar)` once the cursor location has been determined. 

multi.on(...), multi.removeListener(...), multi.destroy(...), multi.write(...)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Call event emitter functions on the underlying `charm` object.

multi.offset
------------

This getter/setter controls the positioning for relative progress bars.

Increment this value whenever you write a newline to the stream to prevent the
pending progress bars from drifting down from their original positions.

bar.percent(p, msg=p + ' %')
----------------------------

Update the progress bar to `p` percent, a value between 0 and 100, inclusive.

The text to the right of the progress bar will be set to `msg`.

bar.ratio(n, d, msg=n + ' / ' + d)
----------------------------------

Update the progress bar with a ratio, `n/d`.

The text to the right of the progress bar will be set to `msg`.

attributes
==========

multi.charm
-----------

The [charm](https://github.com/substack/node-charm) object used internally to
draw the progress bars.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
=================================

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright Â© 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>  
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  1. Additional Definitions. 

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  2. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  3. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

     1. under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
     ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
     function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
     whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

     2. under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
     this License applicable to that copy.

  4. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

     1. Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
     covered by this License.

     2. Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
     document.

  5. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

     1. Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
     the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
     covered by this License.

     2. Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
     document.

     3. For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
     execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
     these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
     copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

     4. Do one of the following:

        1. Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
        Corresponding Source.

        2. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
        Version. 

     5. Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
     be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
     GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
     necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
     Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
     Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
     you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
     the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
     Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
     Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
     for conveying Corresponding Source.)

     6. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

     1. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
     on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
     conveyed under the terms of this License.

     2. Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
     is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
     accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  7. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

## Typed Event Emitter

**NOTE: REQUIRES TYPESCRIPT 3.0**

A TypeScript library for strongly typed event emitters in 0 kB. Declare events using a simple interface mapping event names to their payloads to get stricter versions of `emit`, `on`, and other common EventEmitter APIs. Works with any kind of EventEmitter.

### Installation

```
npm i strict-event-emitter-types
```

### Example

```ts
import StrictEventEmitter from 'strict-event-emitter-types';

// define your events
interface Events {
  request: (request: Request, response: Response) => void;
  done: void;
}

// grab an event emitter
import { EventEmitter } from 'events';

// Create strict event emitter types
let ee: StrictEventEmitter<EventEmitter, Events> = new EventEmitter;

// now enjoy your strongly typed EventEmitter API!ð

ee.on('request', (r, resp) => ... );
// r and resp are contextually typed to Request and Response

ee.on('somethingElse');
// Error: unknown event

ee.on('done', x => x);
// Error: The 'done' event does not have a payload

ee.emit('request', new Request());
// Error: missing event payload (the response)

ee.emit('request', new Request(), false);
// Error: incorrect payload type
```

### Usage

#### Event Records

Event records are interfaces or object types that map event names to the event's payload types. In the following example, three events are declared:

```ts
interface Events {
  req: (request: Request, response: Response) => void;
  done: void;
  conn: Connection;
}
```

Each event shows one of three ways to type the event payloads:

1.  **Function type:** Parameters are the event payload. The return type is ignored.
1.  **`void`:** A shortcut for an event with no payload, i.e. `() => void`
1.  **Anything else:** A shortcut for an event with one payload, for example `(p: number) => void` can be written as just `number`.

#### StrictEventEmitter&lt;TEmitterType, TEventRecord, TEmitRecord>

The default export. A generic type that takes three type parameters:

1.  _TEmitterType_: Your EventEmitter type (e.g. node's EventEmitter or socket.io socket)
2.  _TEventRecord_: A type mapping event names to event payloads
3.  _TEmitRecord_: Optionally, a similar type mapping things you can emit.

The third parameter is handy when typing web sockets where client and server can listen to and emit different events. For example, if you are using socket.io:

```ts
// create types representing the server side and client
// side sockets
export type ServerSocket =
  StrictEventEmitter<SocketIO.Socket, EventsFromServer, EventsFromClient>;
export type ClientSocket =
  StrictEventEmitter<SocketIOClient.Socket, EventsFromClient, EventsFromServer>;

// elsewhere on server
let serverSocket: ServerSocket = new SocketIO.Socket();
serverSocket.on(/* only events that are sent from the client are allowed */, ...)
serverSocket.emit(/* only events that are emitted from the server are allowed */, ...)

// elsewhere on client
let clientSocket: ClientSocket = new SocketIOClient.Socket();
clientSocket.on(/* only events that are sent from the server are allowed */, ...)
clientSocket.emit(/* only events that are emitted from the client are allowed */, ...)
```

##### Usage with Subclasses

To subclass an EventEmitter you need to cast the base EventEmitter to the strict EventEmitter before extending:

```ts
type MyEmitter = StrictEventEmitter<EventEmitter, Events>;

class MyEventEmitter extends (EventEmitter as { new(): MyEmitter }) {
  doEmit() {
    this.emit(...); // strict
  }
}
```

### StrictBroadcast&lt;TStrictEventEmitter>

A type for a function which takes (and strictly checks) an emit event and a payload. _TStrictEventEmitter_ is the event emitter type instantiated from StrictEventEmitter.

Useful for broadcast abstractions. It is not possible to contextually type assigments to this type, so your declarations will look something like this:

```ts
import { StrictBroadcast } from 'strict-event-emitter-types';

const broadcast: StrictBroadcast<ServerSocket> = function(
  event: string,
  payload?: any
) {
  // ...
};
```

Note that the loose types for event and payload only apply inside the broadcast function (consumers will see a much stricter signature). Declaring more precise parameter types or narrowing using type guards would allow strongly-typed dispatching to emitters.

Parses the `url` from a [`IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) request. The returned object will always only contain the following keys: `search`, `query`, `pathname`, and `raw`.

> **Note:** This library does not process `protocol`, `hostname`, `port`, etc.<br>This is because the incoming `req.url` value only begins with the path information.

Parsed requests will be mutated with a `_parsedUrl` key, containing the returned output. This is used for future memoization, avoiding the need to fully parse the same `url` value multiple times.

## Install

```
$ npm install --save @polka/url
```

## Usage

```js
const parse = require('@polka/url');

let req = {
  url: '/foo/bar?fizz=buzz'
};
let output = parse(req);
//=> {
//=>   pathname: '/foo/bar',
//=>   raw: '/foo/bar?fizz=buzz',
//=>   search: '?fizz=buzz',
//=>   query: {
//=>     fizz: 'buzz'
//=>   },
//=> }

// Attaches result for future memoization
assert.deepEqual(output, req._parsedUrl); //=> true
```

## API

### url(req)
Returns: `Object` or `undefined`

> **Important:** The `req` must have a `url` key, otherwise `undefined` will be returned.<br>If no input is provided at all, a `TypeError` will be thrown.

#### req
Type: `IncomingMessage` or `{ url: string }`

The incoming HTTP request (`req`) or a plain `Object` with a `url` key.

> **Note:** In Node.js servers, the [`req.url`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_message_url) begins with a pathname & does not include a `hash`.


## Benchmarks

## Support

Any issues or questions can be sent to the [Polka][polka] repository.<br>However, please specify that your inquiry is about `@polka/url` specifically.

# SQLite Wasm

SQLite Wasm conveniently wrapped as an ES Module.

> [!Warning]
>
> This project wraps the code of
> [SQLite Wasm](https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/index.md) with _no_ changes,
> apart from added TypeScript types. Please do _not_ file issues or feature
> requests regarding the underlying SQLite Wasm code here. Instead, please
> follow the
> [SQLite bug filing instructions](https://www.sqlite.org/src/wiki?name=Bug+Reports).
> Filing TypeScript type related issues and feature requests is fine.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm
```

## Usage

There are three ways to use SQLite Wasm:

- [in the main thread with a wrapped worker](#in-a-wrapped-worker-with-opfs-if-available)
  (ð preferred option)
- [in a worker](#in-a-worker-with-opfs-if-available)
- [in the main thread](#in-the-main-thread-without-opfs)

Only the worker versions allow you to use the origin private file system (OPFS)
storage back-end.

### In a wrapped worker (with OPFS if available):

> [!Warning]
>
> For this to work, you need to set the following headers on your server:
>
> `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
>
> `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`

```js
import { sqlite3Worker1Promiser } from '@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm';

const log = console.log;
const error = console.error;

const initializeSQLite = async () => {
  try {
    log('Loading and initializing SQLite3 module...');

    const promiser = await new Promise((resolve) => {
      const _promiser = sqlite3Worker1Promiser({
        onready: () => resolve(_promiser),
      });
    });

    log('Done initializing. Running demo...');

    const configResponse = await promiser('config-get', {});
    log('Running SQLite3 version', configResponse.result.version.libVersion);

    const openResponse = await promiser('open', {
      filename: 'file:mydb.sqlite3?vfs=opfs',
    });
    const { dbId } = openResponse;
    log(
      'OPFS is available, created persisted database at',
      openResponse.result.filename.replace(/^file:(.*?)\?vfs=opfs$/, '$1'),
    );
    // Your SQLite code here.
  } catch (err) {
    if (!(err instanceof Error)) {
      err = new Error(err.result.message);
    }
    error(err.name, err.message);
  }
};

initializeSQLite();
```

The `promiser` object above implements the
[Worker1 API](https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/api-worker1.md#worker1-methods).

### In a worker (with OPFS if available):

> [!Warning]
>
> For this to work, you need to set the following headers on your server:
>
> `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
>
> `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`

```js
// In `main.js`.
const worker = new Worker('worker.js', { type: 'module' });
```

```js
// In `worker.js`.
import sqlite3InitModule from '@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm';

const log = console.log;
const error = console.error;

const start = (sqlite3) => {
  log('Running SQLite3 version', sqlite3.version.libVersion);
  const db =
    'opfs' in sqlite3
      ? new sqlite3.oo1.OpfsDb('/mydb.sqlite3')
      : new sqlite3.oo1.DB('/mydb.sqlite3', 'ct');
  log(
    'opfs' in sqlite3
      ? `OPFS is available, created persisted database at ${db.filename}`
      : `OPFS is not available, created transient database ${db.filename}`,
  );
  // Your SQLite code here.
};

const initializeSQLite = async () => {
  try {
    log('Loading and initializing SQLite3 module...');
    const sqlite3 = await sqlite3InitModule({ print: log, printErr: error });
    log('Done initializing. Running demo...');
    start(sqlite3);
  } catch (err) {
    error('Initialization error:', err.name, err.message);
  }
};

initializeSQLite();
```

The `db` object above implements the
[Object Oriented API #1](https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/api-oo1.md).

### In the main thread (without OPFS):

```js
import sqlite3InitModule from '@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm';

const log = console.log;
const error = console.error;

const start = (sqlite3) => {
  log('Running SQLite3 version', sqlite3.version.libVersion);
  const db = new sqlite3.oo1.DB('/mydb.sqlite3', 'ct');
  // Your SQLite code here.
};

const initializeSQLite = async () => {
  try {
    log('Loading and initializing SQLite3 module...');
    const sqlite3 = await sqlite3InitModule({
      print: log,
      printErr: error,
    });
    log('Done initializing. Running demo...');
    start(sqlite3);
  } catch (err) {
    error('Initialization error:', err.name, err.message);
  }
};

initializeSQLite();
```

The `db` object above implements the
[Object Oriented API #1](https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/api-oo1.md).

## Usage with vite

If you are using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), you need to add the following
config option in `vite.config.js`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    headers: {
      'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': 'same-origin',
      'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy': 'require-corp',
    },
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    exclude: ['@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm'],
  },
});
```

Check out a
[sample project](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-ttrbwh?file=main.js)
that shows this in action.

## Demo

See the [demo](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite-wasm/tree/main/demo) folder for
examples of how to use this in the main thread and in a worker. (Note that the
worker variant requires special HTTP headers, so it can't be hosted on GitHub
Pages.) An example that shows how to use this with vite is available on
[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-ttrbwh?file=main.js).

## Projects using this package

See the list of
[npm dependents](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm)
for this package.

## Deploying a new version

(These steps can only be executed by maintainers.)

1. Update the version number in `package.json` reflecting the current
   [SQLite version number](https://sqlite.org/download.html) and add a build
   identifier suffix like `-build1`. The complete version number should read
   something like `3.41.2-build1`.
1. Run `npm run build` to build the ES Module. This downloads the latest SQLite
   Wasm binary and builds the ES Module.
1. Run `npm run deploy` to commit the changes, push to GitHub, and publish the
   new version to npm.

## License

Apache 2.0.

## Acknowledgements

This project is based on [SQLite Wasm](https://sqlite.org/wasm), which it
conveniently wraps as an ES Module and publishes to npm as
[`@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm).

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etcâ¦
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) â [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) â undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance

This module is a thin wrapper around the base `http.Agent` class.

It provides an abstract class that must define a `connect()` function,
which is responsible for creating the underlying socket that the HTTP
client requests will use.

The `connect()` function may return an arbitrary `Duplex` stream, or
another `http.Agent` instance to delegate the request to, and may be
asynchronous (by defining an `async` function).

Instances of this agent can be used with the `http` and `https`
modules. To differentiate, the options parameter in the `connect()`
function includes a `secureEndpoint` property, which can be checked
to determine what type of socket should be returned.

#### Some subclasses:

Here are some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS

Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` or `tls.Socket`
based on the `secureEndpoint` property. This agent can be used with both
the `http` and `https` modules.

```ts
import * as net from 'net';
import * as tls from 'tls';
import * as http from 'http';
import { Agent } from 'agent-base';

class MyAgent extends Agent {
  connect(req, opts) {
    // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the "https" module
    if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
      return tls.connect(opts);
    } else {
      return net.connect(opts);
    }
  }
});

// Keep alive enabled means that `connect()` will only be
// invoked when a new connection needs to be created
const agent = new MyAgent({ keepAlive: true });

// Pass the `agent` option when creating the HTTP request
http.get('http://nodejs.org/api/', { agent }, (res) => {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes

    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and

Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Create new error instances with a code and additional properties.


## Installation

```console
$ npm install err-code
// or
$ bower install err-code
```

The browser file is named index.umd.js which supports CommonJS, AMD and globals (errCode).


## Why

I find myself doing this repeatedly:

```js
var err = new Error('My message');
err.code = 'SOMECODE';
err.detail = 'Additional information about the error';
throw err;
```


## Usage

Simple usage.

```js
var errcode = require('err-code');

// fill error with message + code
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), 'ESOMECODE');
// fill error with message + code + props
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), 'ESOMECODE', { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
// fill error with message + props
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
```

## Pre-existing fields

If the passed `Error` already has a `.code` field, or fields specified in the third argument to `errcode` they will be overwritten, unless the fields are read only or otherwise throw during assignment in which case a new object will be created that shares a prototype chain with the original `Error`. The `.stack` and `.message` properties will be carried over from the original error and `.code` or any passed properties will be set on it.


## Tests

`$ npm test`

# Glob To Regular Expression

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/glob-to-regexp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/glob-to-regexp)

Turn a \*-wildcard style glob (`"*.min.js"`) into a regular expression
(`/^.*\.min\.js$/`)!

To match bash-like globs, eg. `?` for any single-character match, `[a-z]` for
character ranges, and `{*.html, *.js}` for multiple alternatives, call with
`{ extended: true }`.

To obey [globstars `**`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) rules set option `{globstar: true}`.
NOTE: This changes the behavior of `*` when `globstar` is `true` as shown below:
When `{globstar: true}`: `/foo/**` will match any string that starts with `/foo/`
like `/foo/index.htm`, `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, etc.  Also, `/foo/**/*.txt` will match
any string that starts with `/foo/` and ends with `.txt` like `/foo/bar.txt`,
`/foo/bar/baz.txt`, etc.
Whereas `/foo/*` (single `*`, not a globstar) will match strings that start with
`/foo/` like `/foo/index.htm`, `/foo/baz.txt` but will not match strings that
contain a `/` to the right like `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, `/foo/bar/baz/qux.dat`, etc.

Set flags on the resulting `RegExp` object by adding the `flags` property to the option object, eg `{ flags: "i" }` for ignoring case.

## Install

    npm install glob-to-regexp

## Usage
```js
var globToRegExp = require('glob-to-regexp');
var re = globToRegExp("p*uck");
re.test("pot luck"); // true
re.test("pluck"); // true
re.test("puck"); // true

re = globToRegExp("*.min.js");
re.test("http://example.com/jquery.min.js"); // true
re.test("http://example.com/jquery.min.js.map"); // false

re = globToRegExp("*/www/*.js");
re.test("http://example.com/www/app.js"); // true
re.test("http://example.com/www/lib/factory-proxy-model-observer.js"); // true

// Extended globs
re = globToRegExp("*/www/{*.js,*.html}", { extended: true });
re.test("http://example.com/www/app.js"); // true
re.test("http://example.com/www/index.html"); // true
```

http-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http` module.

__Note:__ For HTTP proxy usage with the `https` module, check out
[`node-https-proxy-agent`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent).

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install http-proxy-agent
```


Example
-------

``` js
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var HttpProxyAgent = require('http-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

http.get(opts, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

https-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

git clone https://github.com/indutny/node-ip.git
```
  
## Usage
Get your ip address, compare ip addresses, validate ip addresses, etc.

```js
var ip = require('ip');

ip.address() // my ip address
ip.isEqual('::1', '::0:1'); // true
ip.toBuffer('127.0.0.1') // Buffer([127, 0, 0, 1])
ip.toString(new Buffer([127, 0, 0, 1])) // 127.0.0.1
ip.fromPrefixLen(24) // 255.255.255.0
ip.mask('192.168.1.134', '255.255.255.0') // 192.168.1.0
ip.cidr('192.168.1.134/26') // 192.168.1.128
ip.not('255.255.255.0') // 0.0.0.255
ip.or('192.168.1.134', '0.0.0.255') // 192.168.1.255
ip.isPrivate('127.0.0.1') // true
ip.isV4Format('127.0.0.1'); // true
ip.isV6Format('::ffff:127.0.0.1'); // true

// operate on buffers in-place
var buf = new Buffer(128);
var offset = 64;
ip.toBuffer('127.0.0.1', buf, offset);  // [127, 0, 0, 1] at offset 64
ip.toString(buf, offset, 4);            // '127.0.0.1'

// subnet information
ip.subnet('192.168.1.134', '255.255.255.192')
// { networkAddress: '192.168.1.128',
//   firstAddress: '192.168.1.129',
//   lastAddress: '192.168.1.190',
//   broadcastAddress: '192.168.1.191',
//   subnetMask: '255.255.255.192',
//   subnetMaskLength: 26,
//   numHosts: 62,
//   length: 64,
//   contains: function(addr){...} }
ip.cidrSubnet('192.168.1.134/26')
// Same as previous.

// range checking
ip.cidrSubnet('192.168.1.134/26').contains('192.168.1.190') // true


// ipv4 long conversion
ip.toLong('127.0.0.1'); // 2130706433
ip.fromLong(2130706433); // '127.0.0.1'
```

# <img src="https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/website/static/img/jest.png" height="40" align="right" /> [Plug'n'Play](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/pull/101) resolver for Jest

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/jest-pnp-resolver.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-pnp-resolver)
[![node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/jest-pnp-resolver.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-pnp-resolver)

*This plugin is also available for Rollup ([rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve](https://github.com/arcanis/rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve)), TypeScript ([ts-pnp](https://github.com/arcanis/ts-pnp)), and Webpack ([pnp-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin))*

## Installation

```
yarn add -D jest-pnp-resolver
```

## Usage

As of `jest@^24.4.0` you don't need to manually add this package anymore. The default resolver will already use PnP.

Simply add the resolver to your configuration. For example, a minimal `jest.config.js` would be as such:

```js
module.exports = {
  resolver: require.resolve(`jest-pnp-resolver`)
};
```

The Academic Free License, v. 2.1:
**********************************

This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of
authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original
Work:

Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the
following:

a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;

b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original
Work;

c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the
public;

d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent
claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the
Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original
Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as
long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing
the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following
the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing
in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
license.

5) This section intentionally omitted.

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work
or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt
to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by
exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging
patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or
hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 101 et
seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
make it enforceable.

14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means
(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
entity.

15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved.
Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without
modification. This license may not be modified without the express written
permission of its copyright owner.

### mdn-data@2.0.14, mdn-data@2.0.30

From https://github.com/mdn/data.

**CC0-1.0**:

```
CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
  and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
  depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
  a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
  or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
  CC0 or use of the Work.

[npm package]: https://npmjs.org/package/natural-compare-lite
[GitHub repo]: https://github.com/litejs/natural-compare-lite



    @version    1.4.0
    @date       2015-10-26
    @stability  3 - Stable


Natural Compare &ndash; [![Build][]][1] [![Coverage][]][2]
===============

Compare strings containing a mix of letters and numbers
in the way a human being would in sort order.
This is described as a "natural ordering".

```text
Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:
    img1.png            img1.png
    img10.png           img2.png
    img12.png           img10.png
    img2.png            img12.png
```

String.naturalCompare returns a number indicating
whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same
as the given string in sort order.
Use it with builtin sort() function.



### Installation

- In browser

```html
<script src=min.natural-compare.js></script>
```

- In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`

```javascript
require("natural-compare-lite")
```

### Usage

```javascript
// Simple case sensitive example
var a = ["z1.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z2.doc", "z23.doc", "z3.doc"];
a.sort(String.naturalCompare);
// ["z1.doc", "z2.doc", "z3.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z23.doc"]

// Use wrapper function for case insensitivity
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase());
})

// In most cases we want to sort an array of objects
var a = [ {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-1021"}
        , {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-21046-b"} ];

// sort by street, then by room
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room);
})

// When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()),
// it is best for performance to keep
// transformed key in that object.
// There are no need to do text transformation
// on each comparision when sorting.
var a = [ {"make":"Audi", "model":"A6"}
        , {"make":"Kia",  "model":"Rio"} ];

// sort by make, then by model
a.map(function(car){
  car.sort_key = (car.make + " " + car.model).toLowerCase();
})
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key);
})
```

- Works well with dates in ISO format eg "Rev 2012-07-26.doc".


### Custom alphabet

It is possible to configure a custom alphabet
to achieve a desired order.

```javascript
// Estonian alphabet
String.alphabet = "ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSÅ ZÅ½TUVÃÃÃÃXYabdefghijklmnoprsÅ¡zÅ¾tuvÃµÃ¤Ã¶Ã¼xy"
["t", "z", "x", "Ãµ"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// ["z", "t", "Ãµ", "x"]

// Russian alphabet
String.alphabet = "ÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐ Ð¡Ð¢Ð£Ð¤Ð¥Ð¦Ð§Ð¨Ð©ÐªÐ«Ð¬Ð­Ð®Ð¯Ð°Ð±Ð²Ð³Ð´ÐµÑÐ¶Ð·Ð¸Ð¹ÐºÐ»Ð¼Ð½Ð¾Ð¿ÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑ"
["Ð", "Ð", "Ð"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// ["Ð", "Ð", "Ð"]
```

**(BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0)**:

```
You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the
GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
Forge project.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.

If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## API

[See **unified** for API docs Â»][unified]

### `processor().use(parse[, options])`

Configure the `processor` to read Markdown as input and process
[**mdast**][mdast] syntax trees.

##### `options`

Options can be passed directly, or passed later through
[`processor.data()`][data].

###### `options.gfm`

GFM mode (`boolean`, default: `true`).

```markdown
hello ~~hi~~ world
```

Turns on:

*   [Fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#fenced-code-blocks)
*   [Autolinking of URLs](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls)
*   [Deletions (strikethrough)](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#styling-text)
*   [Task lists](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#task-lists)
*   [Tables](https://help.github.com/articles/organizing-information-with-tables)

###### `options.commonmark`

CommonMark mode (`boolean`, default: `false`).

```markdown
This is a paragraph
    and this is also part of the preceding paragraph.
```

Allows:

*   Empty lines to split block quotes
*   Parentheses (`(` and `)`) around link and image titles
*   Any escaped [ASCII punctuation][escapes] character
*   Closing parenthesis (`)`) as an ordered list marker
*   URL definitions in block quotes

Disallows:

*   Indented code blocks directly following a paragraph
*   ATX headings (`# Hash headings`) without spacing after opening hashes or and
    before closing hashes
*   Setext headings (`Underline headings\n---`) when following a paragraph
*   Newlines in link and image titles
*   White space in link and image URLs in auto-links (links in brackets, `<` and
    `>`)
*   Lazy block quote continuation, lines not preceded by a greater than
    character (`>`), for lists, code, and thematic breaks

###### `options.pedantic`

â ï¸ Pedantic was previously used to mimic old-style Markdown mode: no tables, no
fenced code, and with many bugs.
Itâs currently still âworkingâ, but please do not use it, itâll be removed in
the future.

###### `options.blocks`

Blocks (`Array.<string>`, default: list of [block HTML elements][blocks]).

```markdown
<block>foo
</block>
```

Defines which HTML elements are seen as block level.

### `parse.Parser`

Access to the [parser][], if you need it.

## Extending the `Parser`

Typically, using [*transformers*][transformer] to manipulate a syntax tree
produces the desired output.
Sometimes, such as when introducing new syntactic entities with a certain
precedence, interfacing with the parser is necessary.

If the `remark-parse` plugin is used, it adds a [`Parser`][parser] constructor
function to the `processor`.
Other plugins can add tokenizers to its prototype to change how Markdown is
parsed.

The below plugin adds a [tokenizer][] for at-mentions.

```js
module.exports = mentions

function mentions() {
  var Parser = this.Parser
  var tokenizers = Parser.prototype.inlineTokenizers
  var methods = Parser.prototype.inlineMethods

  // Add an inline tokenizer (defined in the following example).
  tokenizers.mention = tokenizeMention

  // Run it just before `text`.
  methods.splice(methods.indexOf('text'), 0, 'mention')
}
```

### `Parser#blockTokenizers`

Map of names to [tokenizer][]s (`Object.<Function>`).
These tokenizers (such as `fencedCode`, `table`, and `paragraph`) eat from the
start of a value to a line ending.

See `#blockMethods` below for a list of methods that are included by default.

### `Parser#blockMethods`

List of `blockTokenizers` names (`Array.<string>`).
Specifies the order in which tokenizers run.

Precedence of default block methods is as follows:

<!--methods-block start-->

*   `blankLine`
*   `indentedCode`
*   `fencedCode`
*   `blockquote`
*   `atxHeading`
*   `thematicBreak`
*   `list`
*   `setextHeading`
*   `html`
*   `definition`
*   `table`
*   `paragraph`

<!--methods-block end-->

### `Parser#inlineTokenizers`

Map of names to [tokenizer][]s (`Object.<Function>`).
These tokenizers (such as `url`, `reference`, and `emphasis`) eat from the start
of a value.
To increase performance, they depend on [locator][]s.

See `#inlineMethods` below for a list of methods that are included by default.

### `Parser#inlineMethods`

List of `inlineTokenizers` names (`Array.<string>`).
Specifies the order in which tokenizers run.

Precedence of default inline methods is as follows:

<!--methods-inline start-->

*   `escape`
*   `autoLink`
*   `url`
*   `email`
*   `html`
*   `link`
*   `reference`
*   `strong`
*   `emphasis`
*   `deletion`
*   `code`
*   `break`
*   `text`

<!--methods-inline end-->

### `function tokenizer(eat, value, silent)`

There are two types of tokenizers: block level and inline level.
Both are functions, and work the same, but inline tokenizers must have a
[locator][].

The following example shows an inline tokenizer that is added by the mentions
plugin above.

```js
tokenizeMention.notInLink = true
tokenizeMention.locator = locateMention

function tokenizeMention(eat, value, silent) {
  var match = /^@(\w+)/.exec(value)

  if (match) {
    if (silent) {
      return true
    }

    return eat(match[0])({
      type: 'link',
      url: 'https://social-network/' + match[1],
      children: [{type: 'text', value: match[0]}]
    })
  }
}
```

Tokenizers *test* whether a document starts with a certain syntactic entity.
In *silent* mode, they return whether that test passes.
In *normal* mode, they consume that token, a process which is called âeatingâ.

Locators enable inline tokenizers to function faster by providing where the next
entity may occur.

###### Signatures

*   `Node? = tokenizer(eat, value)`
*   `boolean? = tokenizer(eat, value, silent)`

###### Parameters

*   `eat` ([`Function`][eat]) â Eat, when applicable, an entity
*   `value` (`string`) â Value which may start an entity
*   `silent` (`boolean`, optional) â Whether to detect or consume

###### Properties

*   `locator` ([`Function`][locator]) â Required for inline tokenizers
*   `onlyAtStart` (`boolean`) â Whether nodes can only be found at the beginning
    of the document
*   `notInBlock` (`boolean`) â Whether nodes cannot be in block quotes or lists
*   `notInList` (`boolean`) â Whether nodes cannot be in lists
*   `notInLink` (`boolean`) â Whether nodes cannot be in links

###### Returns

*   `boolean?`, in *silent* mode â whether a node can be found at the start of
    `value`
*   [`Node?`][node], In *normal* mode â If it can be found at the start of
    `value`

### `tokenizer.locator(value, fromIndex)`

Locators are required for inline tokenizers.
Their role is to keep parsing performant.

The following example shows a locator that is added by the mentions tokenizer
above.

```js
function locateMention(value, fromIndex) {
  return value.indexOf('@', fromIndex)
}
```

Locators enable inline tokenizers to function faster by providing information on
where the next entity *may* occur.
Locators may be wrong, itâs OK if there actually isnât a node to be found at the
index they return.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`) â Value which may contain an entity
*   `fromIndex` (`number`) â Position to start searching at

###### Returns

`number` â Index at which an entity may start, and `-1` otherwise.

### `eat(subvalue)`

```js
var add = eat('foo')
```

Eat `subvalue`, which is a string at the start of the [tokenized][tokenizer]
`value`.

###### Parameters

*   `subvalue` (`string`) - Value to eat

###### Returns

[`add`][add].

### `add(node[, parent])`

```js
var add = eat('foo')

add({type: 'text', value: 'foo'})
```

Add [positional information][position] to `node` and add `node` to `parent`.

###### Parameters

*   `node` ([`Node`][node]) - Node to patch position on and to add
*   `parent` ([`Parent`][parent], optional) - Place to add `node` to in the
    syntax tree.
    Defaults to the currently processed node

###### Returns

[`Node`][node] â The given `node`.

### `add.test()`

Get the [positional information][position] that would be patched on `node` by
`add`.

###### Returns

[`Position`][position].

### `add.reset(node[, parent])`

`add`, but resets the internal position.
Useful for example in lists, where the same content is first eaten for a list,
and later for list items.

###### Parameters

*   `node` ([`Node`][node]) - Node to patch position on and insert
*   `parent` ([`Node`][node], optional) - Place to add `node` to in
    the syntax tree.
    Defaults to the currently processed node

###### Returns

[`Node`][node] â The given node.

### Turning off a tokenizer

In some situations, you may want to turn off a tokenizer to avoid parsing that
syntactic feature.

Preferably, use the [`remark-disable-tokenizers`][remark-disable-tokenizers]
plugin to turn off tokenizers.

Alternatively, this can be done by replacing the tokenizer from
`blockTokenizers` (or `blockMethods`) or `inlineTokenizers` (or
`inlineMethods`).

The following example turns off indented code blocks:

```js
remarkParse.Parser.prototype.blockTokenizers.indentedCode = indentedCode

function indentedCode() {
  return true
}
```

## Security

As Markdown is sometimes used for HTML, and improper use of HTML can open you up
to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of remark can also be unsafe.
When going to HTML, use remark in combination with the [**rehype**][rehype]
ecosystem, and use [`rehype-sanitize`][sanitize] to make the tree safe.

Use of remark plugins could also open you up to other attacks.
Carefully assess each plugin and the risks involved in using them.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`remarkjs/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.
Ideas for new plugins and tools can be posted in [`remarkjs/ideas`][ideas].

A curated list of awesome remark resources can be found in [**awesome
remark**][awesome].

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# sirv ![CI](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

> The optimized and lightweight middleware for serving requests to static assets

You may use `sirv` as a *very* fast and lightweight alternative to [`serve-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static).

The massive performance advantage over `serve-static` is explained by **not** relying on the file system for existence checks on every request. These are expensive interactions and must be avoided whenever possible! Instead, when not in "dev" mode, `sirv` performs all its file-system operations upfront and then relies on its cache for future operations.

This middleware will work out of the box for [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka), Express, and other Express-like frameworks. It will also work with the native `http`, `https` and `http2` modules. It requires _very_ little effort to modify/wrap it for servers that don't accept the `(req, res, next)` signature.

:bulb: For a feature-complete CLI application, check out the sibling [`sirv-cli`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli) package as an alternative to [`zeit/serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve)~!

## Install

```
$ npm install --save sirv
```


## Usage

```js
const sirv = require('sirv');
const polka = require('polka');
const compress = require('compression')();

// Init `sirv` handler
const assets = sirv('public', {
  maxAge: 31536000, // 1Y
  immutable: true
});

polka()
  .use(compress, assets)
  .use('/api', require('./api'))
  .listen(3000, err => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('> Ready on localhost:3000~!');
  });
```


## API

### sirv(dir, opts={})

Returns: `Function`

The returned function is a middleware in the standard Express-like signature: `(req, res, next)`, where `req` is the [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), `res` is the [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), and `next` (in this case) is the function to call if no file was found for the given path.

When defined, a `next()` callback is always called _instead of_ the [`opts.onNoMatch`](#optsonnomatch) callback. However, unlike `onNoMatch`, your `next()` is given no arguments.

#### dir
Type: `String`<br>
Default: `.`

The directory from which to read and serve assets. It is resolved to an absolute path &mdash; you must provide an absolute path yourself if `process.cwd()` is not the correct assumption.

#### opts.dev
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Enable "dev" mode, which disables/skips caching. Instead, `sirv` will traverse the file system ***on every request***.

Additionally, `dev` mode will ignore `maxAge` and `immutable` as these options generate a production-oriented `Cache-Control` header value.

> **Important:** Do not use `dev` mode in production!

#### opts.etag
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Generate and attach an `ETag` header to responses.

> **Note:** If an incoming request's [`If-None-Match` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) matches the `ETag` value, a `304` response is given.

#### opts.dotfiles
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Allow requests to dotfiles (files or directories beginning with a `.`).

> **Note:** Requests to [`/.well-known/*`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615) are always allowed.

#### opts.extensions
Type: `Array<String>`<br>
Default: `['html', 'htm']`

The file extension fallbacks to check for if a pathame is not initially found. For example, if a `/login` request cannot find a `login` filename, it will then look for `login.html` and `login.htm` before giving up~!

> **Important:** Actually, `sirv` will **also** look for `login/index.html` and `login/index.htm` before giving up.

#### opts.gzip
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Determine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.gz` files.<br>
Must be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include "gzip" in order for `sirv` to search for the gzip'd alternative.

> **Note:** The `.gz` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.

```js
// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE
// Showing lookup logic

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] "/foobar.jpg"
lookup([
  '/foobar.jpg.gz', '/foobar.jpg',
  '/foobar.jpg.html.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.gz',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.gz',
  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',
]);

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] "/"
lookup([
  '/index.html.gz',
  '/index.htm.gz',
  '/index.html',
  '/index.htm',
]);
```


#### opts.brotli
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Determine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.br` files.<br>
Must be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include either "br" or "brotli" in order for `sirv` to search for the brotli-compressed alternative.

> **Note:** The `.br` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.

When both `opts.broli` and `opts.gzip` are enabled &mdash; and all conditions are equal &mdash; then the brotli variant always takes priority.

```js
// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE
// Showing lookup logic

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br] "/foobar.jpg"
lookup([
  '/foobar.jpg.br', '/foobar.jpg',
  '/foobar.jpg.html.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.br',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.br',
  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',
]);

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br,gz] "/"
lookup([
  '/index.html.br'
  '/index.htm.br'
  '/index.html.gz'
  '/index.htm.gz'
  '/index.html'
  '/index.htm'
]);
```

#### opts.maxAge
Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Enables the `Cache-Control` header on responses and sets the `max-age` value (in seconds).<br>
For example, `maxAge: 31536000` is equivalent to one year.

#### opts.immutable
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Appends the [`immutable` directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#Revalidation_and_reloading) on your `Cache-Control` header, used for uniquely-named assets that will not change!

> **Important:** Will only work if `opts.maxAge` has a value defined!

#### opts.single
Type: `Boolean` or `String`<br>
Default: `false`

Treat the directory as a single-page application.

When `true`, the directory's index page (default `index.html`) will be sent if the request asset does not exist.<br>
You may pass a `string` value to use a file _instead of_ `index.html` as your fallback.

For example, if "/about" is requested but no variants of that file exist, then the response for "/" is sent instead:

```js
// Note: This is psuedo code to illustrate what's happening

// Request: "/about"
let file = find(['/about', '/about.html', '/about.htm', '/about/index.html', '/about.htm']);
if (file) {
  send(file);
} else if (opts.single === true) {
  file = find(['/', '/index.html', '/index.htm']);
  send(file);
} else if (typeof opts.single === 'string') {
  file = find([opts.single]);
  send(file);
} else {
  // next() or 404
}
```

#### opts.ignores
Type: `false` or `Array<String | RegExp>`

Specify paths/patterns that should ignore the fallback behavior that `opts.single` provides.

By default, any asset-like path (URLs that end with an extension) will be ignored. This means that, for example, if `/foobar.jpg` is not found, a `404` response is sent instead of the `index.html` fallback.

Additionally, any `/.well-known/*` pathname ignores the fallback â as do all other dotfile requests when `opts.dotfiles` is enabled.

Any string value(s) will be passed through `new RegExp(value, 'i')` directly.

Finally, you may set `ignores: false` to disable ***all*** ignores, including the defaults. Put differently, this will fallback ***all*** unknown pathnames to your `index.html` (or custom `opts.single` value).

> **Important:** Only has an effect if `opts.single` is enabled.

#### opts.onNoMatch
Type: `Function`

A custom function to run if a file cannot be found for a given request. <br>By default, `sirv` will send a basic `(404) Not found` response.

The function receives the current `req <IncomingMessage>, res <ServerResponse>` pair for as its two arguments.

> **Note:** This won't run if a `next` callback has been provided to the middleware; see [`sirv`](#sirvdir-opts) description.

#### opts.setHeaders
Type: `Function`

A custom function to append or change any headers on the outgoing response. There is no default.

Its signature is `(res, pathname, stats)`, where `res` is the `ServerResponse`, `pathname` is incoming request path (stripped of queries), and `stats` is the file's result from [`fs.statSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_statsync_path).

socks-proxy-agent
================
### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a
specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http`
and `https` modules.

It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket
connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the "Examples" section below.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install socks-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### TypeScript example

```ts
import https from 'https';
import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';

const info = {
	host: 'br41.nordvpn.com',
	userId: 'your-name@gmail.com',
	password: 'abcdef12345124'
};
const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(info);

https.get('https://jsonip.org', { agent }, (res) => {
	console.log(res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `http` module example

```js
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

http.get(opts, function (res) {
	console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `https` module example

```js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

https.get(opts, function (res) {
	console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);

// initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
	console.log('"open" event!');
	socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
	console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
	socket.close();
});
```

# SPDY Server for node.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/spdy.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/spdy)
[![dependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy/status.svg?style=flat-square)](https://david-dm.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy)

[![Waffle](https://img.shields.io/badge/track-waffle-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://waffle.io/spdy-http2/node-spdy)

With this module you can create [HTTP2][0] / [SPDY][1] servers
in node.js with natural http module interface and fallback to regular https
(for browsers that don't support neither HTTP2, nor SPDY yet).

This module named `spdy` but it [provides](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy/issues/269#issuecomment-239014184) support for both http/2 (h2) and spdy (2,3,3.1). Also, `spdy` is compatible with Express.

## Usage

### Examples

Server:
```javascript
var spdy = require('spdy'),
    fs = require('fs');

var options = {
  // Private key
  key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),

  // Fullchain file or cert file (prefer the former)
  cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-fullchain.pem'),

  // **optional** SPDY-specific options
  spdy: {
    protocols: [ 'h2', 'spdy/3.1', ..., 'http/1.1' ],
    plain: false,

    // **optional**
    // Parse first incoming X_FORWARDED_FOR frame and put it to the
    // headers of every request.
    // NOTE: Use with care! This should not be used without some proxy that
    // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR
    'x-forwarded-for': true,

    connection: {
      windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server's window size

      // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy
      autoSpdy31: false
    }
  }
};

var server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('hello world!');
});

server.listen(3000);
```

Client:
```javascript
var spdy = require('spdy');
var https = require('https');

var agent = spdy.createAgent({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443,

  // Optional SPDY options
  spdy: {
    plain: false,
    ssl: true,

    // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR
    'x-forwarded-for': '127.0.0.1'
  }
});

https.get({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  agent: agent
}, function(response) {
  console.log('yikes');
  // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request
  // ...
  // And once we're done - we may close TCP connection to server
  // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!
  agent.close();
}).end();
```

Please note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level
errors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe
to the `error` event and re-emit the captured error:

```javascript
var agent = spdy.createAgent({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443
}).once('error', function (err) {
  this.emit(err);
});
```

#### Push streams

It is possible to initiate [PUSH_PROMISE][5] to send content to clients _before_
the client requests it.

```javascript
spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  var stream = res.push('/main.js', {
    status: 200, // optional
    method: 'GET', // optional
    request: {
      accept: '*/*'
    },
    response: {
      'content-type': 'application/javascript'
    }
  });
  stream.on('error', function() {
  });
  stream.end('alert("hello from push stream!");');

  res.end('<script src="/main.js"></script>');
}).listen(3000);
```

[PUSH_PROMISE][5] may be sent using the `push()` method on the current response
object.  The signature of the `push()` method is:

`.push('/some/relative/url', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)`

Second argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response.
`callback` will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and a
[Duplex][4] stream as the second argument.

Client usage:
```javascript
var agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ });
var req = http.get({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  agent: agent
}, function(response) {
});
req.on('push', function(stream) {
  stream.on('error', function(err) {
    // Handle error
  });
  // Read data from stream
});
```

NOTE: You're responsible for the `stream` object once given it in `.push()`
callback or `push` event. Hence ignoring `error` event on it will result in
uncaught exception and crash your program.

#### Trailing headers

Server usage:
```javascript
function (req, res) {
  // Send trailing headers to client
  res.addTrailers({ header1: 'value1', header2: 'value2' });

  // On client's trailing headers
  req.on('trailers', function(headers) {
    // ...
  });
}
```

Client usage:
```javascript
var req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {
  // On server's trailing headers
  res.on('trailers', function(headers) {
    // ...
  });
});
req.write('stuff');
req.addTrailers({ /* ... */ });
req.end();
```

#### Options

All options supported by [tls][2] work with node-spdy.

Additional options may be passed via `spdy` sub-object:

* `plain` - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether
  to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet.
* `ssl` - if `false` and `options.plain` is `true`, `http.Server` will be used
  as a `base` class for created server.
* `maxChunk` - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA
  chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about
  interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.
  (defaults to 8192)
* `protocols` - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:
  `['h2','spdy/3.1', 'spdy/3', 'spdy/2','http/1.1', 'http/1.0']`)
* `protocol` - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition,
* `maxStreams` - set "[maximum concurrent streams][3]" protocol option

### API

API is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another
function as base class for SPDYServer.

```javascript
spdy.createServer(
  [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],
  { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument
  [request listener]
).listen([port], [host], [callback]);
```

Request listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're
both instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But three
custom properties are added to both of them: `isSpdy`, `spdyVersion`. `isSpdy`
is `true` when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is
`false` in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. `spdyVersion` is either of: `2`, `3`,
`3.1`, or `4` (for HTTP2).

### stable@0.1.8

From https://github.com/Two-Screen/stable.

**MIT**:


````
## Stable

A stable array sort, because `Array#sort()` is not guaranteed stable.

MIT licensed.

[![Node.js CI](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable)

[![Browser CI](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable)

#### From npm

Install with:

```sh
npm install stable
```

Then use it in Node.js or some other CommonJS environment as:

```js
const stable = require('stable')
```

#### From the browser

Include [`stable.js`] or the minified version [`stable.min.js`]
in your page, then call `stable()`.

 [`stable.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.js
 [`stable.min.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.min.js

#### Usage

The default sort is, as with `Array#sort`, lexicographical:

```js
stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']
stable([10, 1, 5])             // => [1, 10, 5]
```

Unlike `Array#sort`, the default sort is **NOT** in-place. To do an in-place
sort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:

```js
const arr = [10, 1, 5]
stable(arr) === arr          // => false
stable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true
```

A comparator function can be specified:

```js
// Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number.
// This demonstrates the default behavior.
const lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b)
stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']

// Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true.
// This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically.
const greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b
stable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10]
```

### stream-exhaust@1.0.2

From https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.

**MIT**:


````
# stream-exhaust

Ensure that the provided stream is flowing data, even if the stream hasn't been
piped to another stream.

```javascript
var exhaustively = require('stream-exhaust');

exhaustively(fs.createReadStream(__filename))
  .on('close', () => { console.log('all done, despite being streams{1+N}!') });
```

## Prior Art

This is based on [stream-consume](https://github.com/aroneous/stream-consume)
by [aroneous](https://github.com/aroneous). It is a separate package because it has
different semantics:

1. It does not call `.resume()` on streams2+ streams. streams2 streams monkeypatch `.pipe`
when entering flowing mode; avoiding `resume()` avoids that fate.
2. It does not examine `._readableState`; instead it checks for the presence of `._read`.

## API

### exhaust(Stream s) -> Stream s

Takes a stream, `s`, and returns it. Ensures that the stream is flowing, either by calling
`.resume()` if the stream is a streams1 stream, or by piping it to a "black hole" stream that
continually asks for more data.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etcâ¦
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) â [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) â undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a
specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http`
and `https` modules.

It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket
connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the "Examples" section below.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install socks-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### TypeScript example

```ts
import https from 'https';
import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';

const info = {
	host: 'br41.nordvpn.com',
	userId: 'your-name@gmail.com',
	password: 'abcdef12345124'
};
const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(info);

https.get('https://jsonip.org', { agent }, (res) => {
	console.log(res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `http` module example

```js
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

http.get(opts, function (res) {
	console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `https` module example

```js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

https.get(opts, function (res) {
	console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);

// initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
	console.log('"open" event!');
	socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
	console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
	socket.close();
});
```

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the
fullest extent possible.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
     for the public:

     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights

     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of

Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

# node-canvas

![Test](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/workflows/Test/badge.svg)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/canvas.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/canvas)

node-canvas is a [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/)-backed Canvas implementation for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install canvas
```

By default, binaries for macOS, Linux and Windows will be downloaded. If you want to build from source, use `npm install --build-from-source` and see the **Compiling** section below.

The minimum version of Node.js required is **6.0.0**.

### Compiling

If you don't have a supported OS or processor architecture, or you use `--build-from-source`, the module will be compiled on your system. This requires several dependencies, including Cairo and Pango.

For detailed installation information, see the [wiki](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/_pages). One-line installation instructions for common OSes are below. Note that libgif/giflib, librsvg and libjpeg are optional and only required if you need GIF, SVG and JPEG support, respectively. Cairo v1.10.0 or later is required.

OS | Command
----- | -----
OS X | Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):<br/>`brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg pixman`
Ubuntu | `sudo apt-get install build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev`
Fedora | `sudo yum install gcc-c++ cairo-devel pango-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel giflib-devel`
Solaris | `pkgin install cairo pango pkg-config xproto renderproto kbproto xextproto`
OpenBSD | `doas pkg_add cairo pango png jpeg giflib`
Windows | See the [wiki](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/Installation:-Windows)

**Mac OS X v10.11+:** If you have recently updated to Mac OS X v10.11+ and are experiencing trouble when compiling, run the following command: `xcode-select --install`. Read more about the problem [on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32929012/148072).
If you have xcode 10.0 or higher installed, in order to build from source you need NPM 6.4.1 or higher.

## Quick Example

```javascript
const { createCanvas, loadImage } = require('canvas')
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

// Write "Awesome!"
ctx.font = '30px Impact'
ctx.rotate(0.1)
ctx.fillText('Awesome!', 50, 100)

// Draw line under text
var text = ctx.measureText('Awesome!')
ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)'
ctx.beginPath()
ctx.lineTo(50, 102)
ctx.lineTo(50 + text.width, 102)
ctx.stroke()

// Draw cat with lime helmet
loadImage('examples/images/lime-cat.jpg').then((image) => {
  ctx.drawImage(image, 50, 0, 70, 70)

  console.log('<img src="' + canvas.toDataURL() + '" />')
})
```

### createCanvas()

> ```ts
> createCanvas(width: number, height: number, type?: 'PDF'|'SVG') => Canvas
> ```

Creates a Canvas instance. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers, where there is no Canvas constructor. (See `browser.js` for the implementation that runs in browsers.)

```js
const { createCanvas } = require('canvas')
const mycanvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const myPDFcanvas = createCanvas(600, 800, 'pdf') // see "PDF Support" section
```

### createImageData()

> ```ts
> createImageData(width: number, height: number) => ImageData
> createImageData(data: Uint8ClampedArray, width: number, height?: number) => ImageData
> // for alternative pixel formats:
> createImageData(data: Uint16Array, width: number, height?: number) => ImageData
> ```

Creates an ImageData instance. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers.

```js
const { createImageData } = require('canvas')
const width = 20, height = 20
const arraySize = width * height * 4
const mydata = createImageData(new Uint8ClampedArray(arraySize), width)
```

### loadImage()

> ```ts
> loadImage() => Promise<Image>
> ```

Convenience method for loading images. This method works in both Node.js and Web browsers.

```js
const { loadImage } = require('canvas')
const myimg = loadImage('http://server.com/image.png')

myimg.then(() => {
  // do something with image
}).catch(err => {
  console.log('oh no!', err)
})

// or with async/await:
const myimg = await loadImage('http://server.com/image.png')
// do something with image
```

### registerFont()

> ```ts
> registerFont(path: string, { family: string, weight?: string, style?: string }) => void
> ```

To use a font file that is not installed as a system font, use `registerFont()` to register the font with Canvas. *This must be done before the Canvas is created.*

```js
const { registerFont, createCanvas } = require('canvas')
registerFont('comicsans.ttf', { family: 'Comic Sans' })

const canvas = createCanvas(500, 500)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

ctx.font = '12px "Comic Sans"'
ctx.fillText('Everyone hates this font :(', 250, 10)
```

The second argument is an object with properties that resemble the CSS properties that are specified in `@font-face` rules. You must specify at least `family`. `weight`, and `style` are optional and default to `'normal'`.

### Image#src

> ```ts
> img.src: string|Buffer
> ```

As in browsers, `img.src` can be set to a `data:` URI or a remote URL. In addition, node-canvas allows setting `src` to a local file path or `Buffer` instance.

```javascript
const { Image } = require('canvas')

// From a buffer:
fs.readFile('images/squid.png', (err, squid) => {
  if (err) throw err
  const img = new Image()
  img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
  img.onerror = err => { throw err }
  img.src = squid
})

// From a local file path:
const img = new Image()
img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
img.onerror = err => { throw err }
img.src = 'images/squid.png'

// From a remote URL:
img.src = 'http://picsum.photos/200/300'
// ... as above

// From a `data:` URI:
img.src = 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4//8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='
// ... as above
```

*Note: In some cases, `img.src=` is currently synchronous. However, you should always use `img.onload` and `img.onerror`, as we intend to make `img.src=` always asynchronous as it is in browsers. See https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues/1007.*

### Image#dataMode

> ```ts
> img.dataMode: number
> ```

Applies to JPEG images drawn to PDF canvases only.

Setting `img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME` or `Image.MODE_MIME|Image.MODE_IMAGE` enables MIME data tracking of images. When MIME data is tracked, PDF canvases can embed JPEGs directly into the output, rather than re-encoding into PNG. This can drastically reduce filesize and speed up rendering.

```javascript
const { Image, createCanvas } = require('canvas')
const canvas = createCanvas(w, h, 'pdf')
const img = new Image()
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_IMAGE // Only image data tracked
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME // Only mime data tracked
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME | Image.MODE_IMAGE // Both are tracked
```

If working with a non-PDF canvas, image data *must* be tracked; otherwise the output will be junk.

Enabling mime data tracking has no benefits (only a slow down) unless you are generating a PDF.

### Canvas#toBuffer()

> ```ts
> canvas.toBuffer((err: Error|null, result: Buffer) => void, mimeType?: string, config?: any) => void
> canvas.toBuffer(mimeType?: string, config?: any) => Buffer
> ```

Creates a [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) object representing the image contained in the canvas.

* **callback** If provided, the buffer will be provided in the callback instead of being returned by the function. Invoked with an error as the first argument if encoding failed, or the resulting buffer as the second argument if it succeeded. Not supported for mimeType `raw` or for PDF or SVG canvases.
* **mimeType** A string indicating the image format. Valid options are `image/png`, `image/jpeg` (if node-canvas was built with JPEG support), `raw` (unencoded data in BGRA order on little-endian (most) systems, ARGB on big-endian systems; top-to-bottom), `application/pdf` (for PDF canvases) and `image/svg+xml` (for SVG canvases). Defaults to `image/png` for image canvases, or the corresponding type for PDF or SVG canvas.
* **config**
  * For `image/jpeg`, an object specifying the quality (0 to 1), if progressive compression should be used and/or if chroma subsampling should be used: `{quality: 0.75, progressive: false, chromaSubsampling: true}`. All properties are optional.

  * For `image/png`, an object specifying the ZLIB compression level (between 0 and 9), the compression filter(s), the palette (indexed PNGs only), the the background palette index (indexed PNGs only) and/or the resolution (ppi): `{compressionLevel: 6, filters: canvas.PNG_ALL_FILTERS, palette: undefined, backgroundIndex: 0, resolution: undefined}`. All properties are optional.

    Note that the PNG format encodes the resolution in pixels per meter, so if you specify `96`, the file will encode 3780 ppm (~96.01 ppi). The resolution is undefined by default to match common browser behavior.

  * For `application/pdf`, an object specifying optional document metadata: `{title: string, author: string, subject: string, keywords: string, creator: string, creationDate: Date, modDate: Date}`. All properties are optional and default to `undefined`, except for `creationDate`, which defaults to the current date. *Adding metadata requires Cairo 1.16.0 or later.*

    For a description of these properties, see page 550 of [PDF 32000-1:2008](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf).

    Note that there is no standard separator for `keywords`. A space is recommended because it is in common use by other applications, and Cairo will enclose the list of keywords in quotes if a comma or semicolon is used.

**Return value**

If no callback is provided, a [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html). If a callback is provided, none.

#### Examples

```js
// Default: buf contains a PNG-encoded image
const buf = canvas.toBuffer()

// PNG-encoded, zlib compression level 3 for faster compression but bigger files, no filtering
const buf2 = canvas.toBuffer('image/png', { compressionLevel: 3, filters: canvas.PNG_FILTER_NONE })

// JPEG-encoded, 50% quality
const buf3 = canvas.toBuffer('image/jpeg', { quality: 0.5 })

// Asynchronous PNG
canvas.toBuffer((err, buf) => {
  if (err) throw err // encoding failed
  // buf is PNG-encoded image
})

canvas.toBuffer((err, buf) => {
  if (err) throw err // encoding failed
  // buf is JPEG-encoded image at 95% quality
}, 'image/jpeg', { quality: 0.95 })

// BGRA pixel values, native-endian
const buf4 = canvas.toBuffer('raw')
const { stride, width } = canvas
// In memory, this is `canvas.height * canvas.stride` bytes long.
// The top row of pixels, in BGRA order on little-endian hardware,
// left-to-right, is:
const topPixelsBGRALeftToRight = buf4.slice(0, width * 4)
// And the third row is:
const row3 = buf4.slice(2 * stride, 2 * stride + width * 4)

// SVG and PDF canvases
const myCanvas = createCanvas(w, h, 'pdf')
myCanvas.toBuffer() // returns a buffer containing a PDF-encoded canvas
// With optional metadata:
myCanvas.toBuffer('application/pdf', {
  title: 'my picture',
  keywords: 'node.js demo cairo',
  creationDate: new Date()
})
```

### Canvas#createPNGStream()

> ```ts
> canvas.createPNGStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream
> ```

Creates a [`ReadableStream`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) that emits PNG-encoded data.

* `config` An object specifying the ZLIB compression level (between 0 and 9), the compression filter(s), the palette (indexed PNGs only) and/or the background palette index (indexed PNGs only): `{compressionLevel: 6, filters: canvas.PNG_ALL_FILTERS, palette: undefined, backgroundIndex: 0, resolution: undefined}`. All properties are optional.

#### Examples

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')
const out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/test.png')
const stream = canvas.createPNGStream()
stream.pipe(out)
out.on('finish', () =>  console.log('The PNG file was created.'))
```

To encode indexed PNGs from canvases with `pixelFormat: 'A8'` or `'A1'`, provide an options object:

```js
const palette = new Uint8ClampedArray([
  //r    g    b    a
    0,  50,  50, 255, // index 1
   10,  90,  90, 255, // index 2
  127, 127, 255, 255
  // ...
])
canvas.createPNGStream({
  palette: palette,
  backgroundIndex: 0 // optional, defaults to 0
})
```

### Canvas#createJPEGStream()

> ```ts
> canvas.createJPEGStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream
> ```

Creates a [`ReadableStream`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) that emits JPEG-encoded data.

*Note: At the moment, `createJPEGStream()` is synchronous under the hood. That is, it runs in the main thread, not in the libuv threadpool.*

* `config` an object specifying the quality (0 to 1), if progressive compression should be used and/or if chroma subsampling should be used: `{quality: 0.75, progressive: false, chromaSubsampling: true}`. All properties are optional.

#### Examples

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')
const out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/test.jpeg')
const stream = canvas.createJPEGStream()
stream.pipe(out)
out.on('finish', () =>  console.log('The JPEG file was created.'))

// Disable 2x2 chromaSubsampling for deeper colors and use a higher quality
const stream = canvas.createJPEGStream({
  quality: 0.95,
  chromaSubsampling: false
})
```

### Canvas#createPDFStream()

> ```ts
> canvas.createPDFStream(config?: any) => ReadableStream
> ```

* `config` an object specifying optional document metadata: `{title: string, author: string, subject: string, keywords: string, creator: string, creationDate: Date, modDate: Date}`. See `toBuffer()` for more information. *Adding metadata requires Cairo 1.16.0 or later.*

Applies to PDF canvases only. Creates a [`ReadableStream`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) that emits the encoded PDF. `canvas.toBuffer()` also produces an encoded PDF, but `createPDFStream()` can be used to reduce memory usage.

### Canvas#toDataURL()

This is a standard API, but several non-standard calls are supported. The full list of supported calls is:

```js
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL() // defaults to PNG
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/png')
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg')
dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', quality) // quality from 0 to 1
canvas.toDataURL((err, png) => { }) // defaults to PNG
canvas.toDataURL('image/png', (err, png) => { })
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', (err, jpeg) => { }) // sync JPEG is not supported
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', {...opts}, (err, jpeg) => { }) // see Canvas#createJPEGStream for valid options
canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', quality, (err, jpeg) => { }) // spec-following; quality from 0 to 1
```

### CanvasRenderingContext2D#patternQuality

> ```ts
> context.patternQuality: 'fast'|'good'|'best'|'nearest'|'bilinear'
> ```

Defaults to `'good'`. Affects pattern (gradient, image, etc.) rendering quality.

### CanvasRenderingContext2D#quality

> ```ts
> context.quality: 'fast'|'good'|'best'|'nearest'|'bilinear'
> ```

Defaults to `'good'`. Like `patternQuality`, but applies to transformations affecting more than just patterns.

### CanvasRenderingContext2D#textDrawingMode

> ```ts
> context.textDrawingMode: 'path'|'glyph'
> ```

Defaults to `'path'`. The effect depends on the canvas type:

* **Standard (image)** `glyph` and `path` both result in rasterized text. Glyph mode is faster than `path`, but may result in lower-quality text, especially when rotated or translated.

* **PDF** `glyph` will embed text instead of paths into the PDF. This is faster to encode, faster to open with PDF viewers, yields a smaller file size and makes the text selectable. The subset of the font needed to render the glyphs will be embedded in the PDF. This is usually the mode you want to use with PDF canvases.

* **SVG** `glyph` does *not* cause `<text>` elements to be produced as one might expect ([cairo bug](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/cairo/cairo/issues/253)). Rather, `glyph` will create a `<defs>` section with a `<symbol>` for each glyph, then those glyphs be reused via `<use>` elements. `path` mode creates a `<path>` element for each text string. `glyph` mode is faster and yields a smaller file size.

In `glyph` mode, `ctx.strokeText()` and `ctx.fillText()` behave the same (aside from using the stroke and fill style, respectively).

This property is tracked as part of the canvas state in save/restore.

### CanvasRenderingContext2D#globalCompositeOperation = 'saturate'

In addition to all of the standard global composite operations defined by the Canvas specification, the ['saturate'](https://www.cairographics.org/operators/#saturate) operation is also available.

### CanvasRenderingContext2D#antialias

> ```ts
> context.antialias: 'default'|'none'|'gray'|'subpixel'
> ```

Sets the anti-aliasing mode.

## PDF Output Support

node-canvas can create PDF documents instead of images. The canvas type must be set when creating the canvas as follows:

```js
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 500, 'pdf')
```

An additional method `.addPage()` is then available to create multiple page PDFs:

```js
// On first page
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)

ctx.addPage()
// Now on second page
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World 2', 50, 80)

canvas.toBuffer() // returns a PDF file
canvas.createPDFStream() // returns a ReadableStream that emits a PDF
// With optional document metadata (requires Cairo 1.16.0):
canvas.toBuffer('application/pdf', {
  title: 'my picture',
  keywords: 'node.js demo cairo',
  creationDate: new Date()
})
```

It is also possible to create pages with different sizes by passing `width` and `height` to the `.addPage()` method:

```js
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica'
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80)
ctx.addPage(400, 800)

ctx.fillText('Hello World 2', 50, 80)
```

See also:

* [Image#dataMode](#imagedatamode) for embedding JPEGs in PDFs
* [Canvas#createPDFStream()](#canvascreatepdfstream) for creating PDF streams
* [CanvasRenderingContext2D#textDrawingMode](#canvasrenderingcontext2dtextdrawingmode)
  for embedding text instead of paths

## SVG Output Support

node-canvas can create SVG documents instead of images. The canvas type must be set when creating the canvas as follows:

```js
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 500, 'svg')
// Use the normal primitives.
fs.writeFileSync('out.svg', canvas.toBuffer())
```

## SVG Image Support

If librsvg is available when node-canvas is installed, node-canvas can render SVG images to your canvas context. This currently works by rasterizing the SVG image (i.e. drawing an SVG image to an SVG canvas will not preserve the SVG data).

```js
const img = new Image()
img.onload = () => ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0)
img.onerror = err => { throw err }
img.src = './example.svg'
```

## Image pixel formats (experimental)

node-canvas has experimental support for additional pixel formats, roughly following the [Canvas color space proposal](https://github.com/WICG/canvas-color-space/blob/master/CanvasColorSpaceProposal.md).

```js
const canvas = createCanvas(200, 200)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d', { pixelFormat: 'A8' })
```

By default, canvases are created in the `RGBA32` format, which corresponds to the native HTML Canvas behavior. Each pixel is 32 bits. The JavaScript APIs that involve pixel data (`getImageData`, `putImageData`) store the colors in the order {red, green, blue, alpha} without alpha pre-multiplication. (The C++ API stores the colors in the order {alpha, red, green, blue} in native-[endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) ordering, with alpha pre-multiplication.)

These additional pixel formats have experimental support:

* `RGB24` Like `RGBA32`, but the 8 alpha bits are always opaque. This format is always used if the `alpha` context attribute is set to false (i.e. `canvas.getContext('2d', {alpha: false})`). This format can be faster than `RGBA32` because transparency does not need to be calculated.
* `A8` Each pixel is 8 bits. This format can either be used for creating grayscale images (treating each byte as an alpha value), or for creating indexed PNGs (treating each byte as a palette index) (see [the example using alpha values with `fillStyle`](examples/indexed-png-alpha.js) and [the example using `imageData`](examples/indexed-png-image-data.js)).
* `RGB16_565` Each pixel is 16 bits, with red in the upper 5 bits, green in the middle 6 bits, and blue in the lower 5 bits, in native platform endianness. Some hardware devices and frame buffers use this format. Note that PNG does not support this format; when creating a PNG, the image will be converted to 24-bit RGB. This format is thus suboptimal for generating PNGs. `ImageData` instances for this mode use a `Uint16Array` instead of a `Uint8ClampedArray`.
* `A1` Each pixel is 1 bit, and pixels are packed together into 32-bit quantities. The ordering of the bits matches the endianness of the
  platform: on a little-endian machine, the first pixel is the least-significant bit. This format can be used for creating single-color images. *Support for this format is incomplete, see note below.*
* `RGB30` Each pixel is 30 bits, with red in the upper 10, green in the middle 10, and blue in the lower 10. (Requires Cairo 1.12 or later.) *Support for this format is incomplete, see note below.*

Notes and caveats:

* Using a non-default format can affect the behavior of APIs that involve pixel data:

  * `context2d.createImageData` The size of the array returned depends on the number of bit per pixel for the underlying image data format, per the above descriptions.
  * `context2d.getImageData` The format of the array returned depends on the underlying image mode, per the above descriptions. Be aware of platform endianness, which can be determined using node.js's [`os.endianness()`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_endianness)
    function.
  * `context2d.putImageData` As above.

* `A1` and `RGB30` do not yet support `getImageData` or `putImageData`. Have a use case and/or opinion on working with these formats? Open an issue and let us know! (See #935.)

* `A1`, `A8`, `RGB30` and `RGB16_565` with shadow blurs may crash or not render properly.

* The `ImageData(width, height)` and `ImageData(Uint8ClampedArray, width)` constructors assume 4 bytes per pixel. To create an `ImageData` instance with a different number of bytes per pixel, use `new ImageData(new Uint8ClampedArray(size), width, height)` or `new ImageData(new Uint16ClampedArray(size), width, height)`.

## Testing

First make sure you've built the latest version. Get all the deps you need (see [compiling](#compiling) above), and run:

```
npm install --build-from-source
```

For visual tests: `npm run test-server` and point your browser to http://localhost:4000.

For unit tests: `npm run test`.

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks live in the `benchmarks` directory.

## Examples

Examples line in the `examples` directory. Most produce a png image of the same name, and others such as *live-clock.js* launch an HTTP server to be viewed in the browser.

# chromium-pickle-js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/electron/node-chromium-pickle-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/electron/node-chromium-pickle-js)

This module ports Chromium's `Pickle` class to Node, see `Pickle`'s header for
introduction:

> This class provides facilities for basic binary value packing and unpacking.
>
> The Pickle class supports appending primitive values (ints, strings, etc.)
> to a pickle instance.  The Pickle instance grows its internal memory buffer
> dynamically to hold the sequence of primitive values.   The internal memory
> buffer is exposed as the "data" of the Pickle.  This "data" can be passed
> to a Pickle object to initialize it for reading.
>
> When reading from a Pickle object, it is important for the consumer to know
> what value types to read and in what order to read them as the Pickle does
> not keep track of the type of data written to it.
>
> The Pickle's data has a header which contains the size of the Pickle's
> payload.  It can optionally support additional space in the header.  That
> space is controlled by the header_size parameter passed to the Pickle
> constructor.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install chromium-pickle-js
```

## Usage

### createEmpty()

Returns an empty `Pickle` object.

### createFromBuffer(buffer)

* `buffer` Buffer

Returns a `Pickle` object that initialized from a `buffer`. The data is not
copied so you have to ensure the `buffer` lives when using the Pickle object,
and you should never modify the Pickle object created this way.

### Pickle.createIterator()

Returns a `PickleIterator` object that can be used to read data from this
`Pickle` object.

### Pickle.toBuffer()

Returns a `Buffer` object that contains this `Pickle` object's data.

### Pickle.writeBool(value)

Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `bool`. Returns `true` when succeeded and
returns `false` when failed.

### Pickle.writeInt(value)

Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `int`. Returns `true` when succeeded and
returns `false` when failed.

### Pickle.writeUInt32(value)

Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `uint32`. Returns `true` when succeeded and
returns `false` when failed.

### Pickle.writeInt64(value)

Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `int64`. Returns `true` when succeeded and
returns `false` when failed.

# tmp-promise

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/benjamingr/tmp-promise.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/benjamingr/tmp-promise)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/tmp-promise.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/tmp-promise)

A simple utility for creating temporary files or directories.

The [tmp](https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp) package with promises support. If you want to use `tmp` with `async/await` then this helper might be for you.

This documentation is mostly copied from that package's - but with promise usage instead of callback usage adapted.

## Installation

    npm i tmp-promise

**Note:** Node.js 8+ is supported - older versions of Node.js are not supported by the Node.js foundation. If you need to use an older version of Node.js install tmp-promise@1.10

    npm i tmp-promise@1.1.0

## About

This adds promises support to a [widely used library][2]. This package is used to create temporary files and directories in a [Node.js][1] environment.
 

tmp-promise offers both an asynchronous and a synchronous API. For all API calls, all
the parameters are optional.

Internally, tmp uses crypto for determining random file names, or, when using templates, a six letter random identifier. And just in case that you do not have that much entropy left on your system, tmp will fall back to pseudo random numbers.

You can set whether you want to remove the temporary file on process exit or not, and the destination directory can also be set.

tmp-promise also uses promise [disposers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28915677/what-is-the-promise-disposer-pattern) to provide a nice way to perform cleanup when you're done working with the files.

## Usage (API Reference)

### Asynchronous file creation

Simple temporary file creation, the file will be closed and unlinked on process exit.

With Node.js 10 and es - modules:

```js
import { file } from 'tmp-promise'

(async () => {
  const {fd, path, cleanup} = await file();
  // work with file here in fd
  cleanup();
})(); 
```

Or the older way:

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');

tmp.file().then(o => {  
  console.log("File: ", o.path);
  console.log("Filedescriptor: ", o.fd);
  
  // If we don't need the file anymore we could manually call cleanup
  // But that is not necessary if we didn't pass the keep option because the library
  // will clean after itself.
  o.cleanup();
});
```

Simple temporary file creation with a [disposer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28915677/what-is-the-promise-disposer-pattern):

With Node.js 10 and es - modules:

```js
import { withFile } from 'tmp-promise'

withFile(async ({path, fd}) => {
  // when this function returns or throws - release the file 
  await doSomethingWithFile(db);
});
```

Or the older way:

```js
tmp.withFile(o => {
  console.log("File: ", o.path);
  console.log("Filedescriptor: ", o.fd);
  // the file remains opens until the below promise resolves
  return somePromiseReturningFn();
}).then(v => {
  // file is closed here automatically, v is the value of somePromiseReturningFn
});
```


### Synchronous file creation

A synchronous version of the above.

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');

var tmpobj = tmp.fileSync();
console.log("File: ", tmpobj.name);
console.log("Filedescriptor: ", tmpobj.fd);
  
// If we don't need the file anymore we could manually call the removeCallback
// But that is not necessary if we didn't pass the keep option because the library
// will clean after itself.
tmpobj.removeCallback();
```

Note that this might throw an exception if either the maximum limit of retries
for creating a temporary name fails, or, in case that you do not have the permission
to write to the directory where the temporary file should be created in.

### Asynchronous directory creation

Simple temporary directory creation, it will be removed on process exit.

If the directory still contains items on process exit, then it won't be removed.

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');

tmp.dir().then(o => {
  console.log("Dir: ", o.path);
  
  // Manual cleanup
  o.cleanup();
});
```

If you want to cleanup the directory even when there are entries in it, then
you can pass the `unsafeCleanup` option when creating it.

You can also use a [disposer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28915677/what-is-the-promise-disposer-pattern) here which takes care of cleanup automatically: 

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');

tmp.withDir(o => {
  console.log("Dir: ", o.path);
  
  // automatic cleanup when the below promise resolves
  return somePromiseReturningFn(); 
}).then(v => {
  // the directory has been cleaned here
});
```

### Synchronous directory creation

A synchronous version of the above.

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');

var tmpobj = tmp.dirSync();
console.log("Dir: ", tmpobj.name);
// Manual cleanup
tmpobj.removeCallback();
```

Note that this might throw an exception if either the maximum limit of retries
for creating a temporary name fails, or, in case that you do not have the permission
to write to the directory where the temporary directory should be created in.

### Asynchronous filename generation

It is possible with this library to generate a unique filename in the specified
directory.

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');

tmp.tmpName().then(path => {
    console.log("Created temporary filename: ", path);
});
```

### Synchronous filename generation

A synchronous version of the above.

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');

var name = tmp.tmpNameSync();
console.log("Created temporary filename: ", name);
```

## Advanced usage

### Asynchronous file creation

Creates a file with mode `0644`, prefix will be `prefix-` and postfix will be `.txt`.

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');

tmp.file({ mode: 0644, prefix: 'prefix-', postfix: '.txt' }).then(o => {
  console.log("File: ", o.path);
  console.log("Filedescriptor: ", o.fd); 
});
```

### Synchronous file creation

A synchronous version of the above.

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');

var tmpobj = tmp.fileSync({ mode: 0644, prefix: 'prefix-', postfix: '.txt' });
console.log("File: ", tmpobj.name);
console.log("Filedescriptor: ", tmpobj.fd);
```

### Asynchronous directory creation

Creates a directory with mode `0755`, prefix will be `myTmpDir_`.

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');

tmp.dir({ mode: 0750, prefix: 'myTmpDir_' }).then(o => {
  console.log("Dir: ", o.path);
});
```

### Synchronous directory creation

Again, a synchronous version of the above.

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');

var tmpobj = tmp.dirSync({ mode: 0750, prefix: 'myTmpDir_' });
console.log("Dir: ", tmpobj.name);
```


### mkstemp like, asynchronously

Creates a new temporary directory with mode `0700` and filename like `/tmp/tmp-nk2J1u`.

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');
tmp.dir({ template: '/tmp/tmp-XXXXXX' }).then(console.log);
```


### mkstemp like, synchronously

This will behave similarly to the asynchronous version.

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');

var tmpobj = tmp.dirSync({ template: '/tmp/tmp-XXXXXX' });
console.log("Dir: ", tmpobj.name);
```

### Asynchronous filename generation

The `tmpName()` function accepts the `prefix`, `postfix`, `dir`, etc. parameters also:

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');

tmp.tmpName({ template: '/tmp/tmp-XXXXXX' }).then(path =>
    console.log("Created temporary filename: ", path);
);
```

### Synchronous filename generation

The `tmpNameSync()` function works similarly to `tmpName()`.

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp-promise');
var tmpname = tmp.tmpNameSync({ template: '/tmp/tmp-XXXXXX' });
console.log("Created temporary filename: ", tmpname);
```


## Graceful cleanup

One may want to cleanup the temporary files even when an uncaught exception
occurs. To enforce this, you can call the `setGracefulCleanup()` method:

```javascript
var tmp = require('tmp');

tmp.setGracefulCleanup();
```

## Options

All options are optional :)

  * `mode`: the file mode to create with, it fallbacks to `0600` on file creation and `0700` on directory creation
  * `prefix`: the optional prefix, fallbacks to `tmp-` if not provided
  * `postfix`: the optional postfix, fallbacks to `.tmp` on file creation
  * `template`: [`mkstemp`][3] like filename template, no default
  * `dir`: the optional temporary directory, fallbacks to system default (guesses from environment)
  * `tries`: how many times should the function try to get a unique filename before giving up, default `3`
  * `keep`: signals that the temporary file or directory should not be deleted on exit, default is `false`, means delete
    * Please keep in mind that it is recommended in this case to call the provided `cleanupCallback` function manually.
  * `unsafeCleanup`: recursively removes the created temporary directory, even when it's not empty. default is `false`

````
# truncate-utf8-bytes [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/parshap/truncate-utf8-bytes.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/parshap/truncate-utf8-bytes)

Truncate a string to the given length in bytes. Correctly handles
multi-byte characters and surrogate pairs.

A browser implementation that doesn't use `Buffer.byteLength` is
provided to minimize build size.

## Example

```js
var truncate = require("truncate-utf8-bytes")
var str = "aâ" // a = 1 byte, â = 3 bytes
console.log(truncate(str, 2))
// -> "a"
```

## API

### `var truncate = require("truncate-utf8-bytes")`

*When using browserify or webpack*, this automatically resolves to an
implementation that does not use `Buffer.byteLength`.

### `truncate(string, length)`

Returns `string` truncated to at most `length` bytes in length.

````
# utf8-byte-length [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/parshap/utf8-byte-length.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/parshap/utf8-byte-length)

Get the utf8 byte length of a string, taking into account multi-byte
characters and surrogate pairs.

By default, this module defers to `Buffer.byteLength`. A browser
implementation is also provided that doesn't use `Buffer.byteLength`
minimize build size.

## Example

```js
var getLength = require("utf8-byte-length")
console.log(truncate("aâ", 2)) // a = 1 byte, â = 3 bytes
// -> 4
```

## API

### `var getLength = require("utf8-byte-length")`

*When using browserify or webpack*, this automatically resolves to an
implementation that does not use `Buffer.byteLength`.

### `getLength(string)`

Returns the byte length of `string`. Throws an error if `string` is not
a string.

    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
